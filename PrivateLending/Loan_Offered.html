    <b>Fix And Flip Hard Money Loans</b><br><br>
If you are a real estate investor looking to acquire properties that require all-cash to purchase or want to buy a property that won't qualify for a conventional loan, we offer same-day pre-approval letters. Our Fix and Flip loans do require that you have some financial skin in the game but do not require appraisals, home inspections, or budget approvals. We give you the full loan amount at closing so there is no draw process. We never charge pre-payment penalties, so our fix and flip loans can be paid off at any time. You also can always keep your loan with us as long as you need it, we never charge extension fees.

    <b>Buy, Rehab, Renovate and Refinance (BRRR Loans)</b><br><br>
Are you looking to purchase a distressed property, make improvements, and then turn it into a source of income? Good deals don't last long and commonly need cash to purchase! A hard money loan gives you the cash you need to buy foreclosures and short sales. We also lend on distressed properties that are not conventionally financeable. At NW Private Lending we help our clients purchase and renovate those homes and work with you to refinance that loan with a low-rate conventional mortgage. Call us today to receive your pre-approval letter!

Are you property rich, but cash poor? Have you paid off or paid down a piece of real estate only to find the bank won't lend to you or they are taking too long? You are not alone. With changes in conventional lending standards, this is becoming a huge problem for many savers who want to get cash out of their real estate holdings. We love helping our clients and can quickly and easily convert your saved equity into cash. We make our own decisions and don't require W2 income, tax returns, credit scores, or debt-to-income ratios to do it.

    <b>1031 & Reverse 1031 Exchange Loans</b><br><br>
In simple terms, a 1031 or reverse 1031 exchange is the way expert real estate investors defer taxes on profits made from the sale of one or several investment properties through the reinvestment of those profits into another investment property. The tax savings can be a huge, but it does require proper documentation and is very time sensitive! If you miss the government’s timelines you will not qualify for the tax benefit. NW Private Lending can connect you with a local 1031 exchange expert and can close on purchases within 3-5 business days. We specialize in last-minute solutions to complex transactions.
