<h2>Cash-Out Refinance Loans</h2>
A Cash out refinance is a pretty common loan these days and can be supported my most conventional lenders. But what if you cannot qualify for a conventional loan how do you get access to the equity in your real estate if you need it? We work with business owners and self-employed clients who do not qualify conventionally but can also help people who have recently become divorced, retired or received real estate as an inheritance but don’t qualify to get a loan from a bank.  Since we don’t pull credit or require tax returns our loans can support those who don’t fit in the box.

<h2>Is a Cash-Out Refinance right for me?</h2>
Well it depends, you are not a number and NW Private Lending is not a bank. We don’t evaluate our clients with FICO scores, citizenship, or debt to income calculations. We are a Private Lending company who gets to know our clients situations and works to do everything we can to solve problems. If you need quick cash out of your investment real estate we can give it to you, but will work with you to make sure it is the best financial decision for you.
