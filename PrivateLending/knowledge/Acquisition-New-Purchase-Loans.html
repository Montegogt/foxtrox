<h2>Acquisition / New Purchase Loans</h2>
The most common of all loans is the loan given to a borrower to purchase or acquire a new primary residence. We believe that this space is best served by conventional lenders and banks who can offer 30-year terms as well as government sponsored loan products like FHA, VA and others. That being said, both the banks and conventional lenders have very specific guidelines for a borrower to qualify for those loans.

But what if you have a large down-payment but still cannot qualify for a conventional loan? At Northwest Private Lending, we work with clients in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington who can’t qualify conventionally or don’t have the time to jump through all the hoops. Since we don’t pull credit or require tax returns our loans can support those who don’t fit in the box or don’t want to deal with the hassle.

<h2>When should I use a Hard Money loan on a new purchase?</h2>
Well it depends, you are not a number and NW Private Lending is not a bank. We don’t evaluate our clients with FICO scores, citizenship, or debt to income calculations. We are a Private Lending company who gets to know our clients situations and works to do everything we can to solve problems and help you to make the best financial decision for you.
