<h2>Commercial / Industrial Loans</h2>
Commercial and Industrial properties cover a huge spectrum. They can be office buildings, retail spaces, or mixed-use buildings. They can also be RV parks, Industrial or storage facilities. Even bare land can fall into the commercial lending world. At Northwest Private Lending, we work outside the banks to secure investment capital for clients in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington.

<h2>Is a Commercial Loan right for me?</h2>
Are you looking for a loan to purchase or renovate a commercial building but are struggling to find banks that will lend you the money? As an equity-based lender, we lend our own money and make our own decisions based on the value of the deal, not your tax returns, tenants, or business history. The commercial space is a broad category with a variety of loan options
