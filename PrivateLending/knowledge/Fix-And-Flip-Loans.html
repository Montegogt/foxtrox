<h2>Fix And Flip Loans</h2>
When it comes to fixing and flipping real estate in today’s housing market, cash and speed are essential. At Northwest Private Lending, we provide hard money loans which act like cash so that our clients can make competitive offers on properties they’d otherwise miss out on. Our fix and flip hard money loans provide up to 80% of the purchase price, which leaves our clients with the cash they need to renovate the property themselves. We never charge prepayment penalties, allowing you to sell the property as quickly as possible. We also do not charge extension fees, so if your project takes longer than expected you can have confidence that you can keep your loan with us as long as you need it.

<h2>Is A Fix & Flip Loan Right For Me?</h2>
With the advent of binge-worthy television shows like Fixer Upper and Property Brothers, buying, restoring, and selling distressed real estate properties is becoming an increasingly common practice, and with good reason. With the help of a fix and flip loan, a little sweat equity, and an eye for the right properties can yield a great return on your investment.
