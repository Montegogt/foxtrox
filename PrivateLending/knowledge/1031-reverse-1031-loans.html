<h2>1031 & Reverse 1031 Loans</h2>
Real Estate like many assets gives the owner the opportunity to gain value over time. That increased equity in the property grows tax-deferred until the property is sold. A 1031 exchange is a tax advantage given to investors who sell an investment property and use the funds to purchase another investment property of equal or greater value. A reverse 1031 exchange is when you purchase the investment property before you sell the existing investment property you already own.

<h2>Is a 1031 or Reverse 1031 Loan right for me?</h2>
It’s is not uncommon for investors who are coming to the end of that 1031 exchange window to use a hard money loan to purchase the new property quickly. Once they completed the 1031 exchange and have ownership of the property, they will then refinance the loan when they have more time to get a conventional loan. If the sale and purchase of the new property is completed within a short window it can be done so, tax free.

<h2>1031 Exchange & Reverse 1031 Exchange. Made Simple.</h2>
<b>1031 Exchange – (Sell then Buy)</b> When a client sells an investment property and takes 100% of the proceeds to invest in another investment property.  I done correctly the profit from the sale can be rolled into the new investment tax-free.

<b>Reverse 1031 Exchange – (Buy then Sell)</b> When a client first purchases a property they wish to hold as an investment then sells another investment property and uses the profits to pay for that property.  When done correctly this can also be done tax-free.
