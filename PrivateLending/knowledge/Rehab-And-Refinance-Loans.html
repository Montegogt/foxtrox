<h2>Rehab And Refinance Loans</h2>
Commonly called the BRRR Method, Northwest Private Lending’s Rehab & Refinance program allows the borrower to purchase distressed properties, make improvements, and ultimately refinance after finding tenants for rentals. We offer up to 80% of the borrowers’ purchase price. Once you have fixed up the property and have it rented out, we can work with you to get a long-term, low rate 30-year fixed mortgage.

<h2>Is a Rehab and Refinance Loan right for me?</h2>
Many real estate investors are looking for ways to build recurring monthly revenue by growing their rental portfolio. Perhaps you’re a first-time developer looking for capital to make a cash offer on a property that needs a bit of work before renting out. Or maybe you’re a seasoned investor looking to do an extensive renovation. Whatever your situation, Northwest Private Lending is here to talk through your lending needs.

<h2>What Is The BRRRR Method?</h2>
Most of us would agree that investing in real estate is a great way to build wealth and create monthly cashflow…but have you ever wondered how professional real estate investors are able to purchase those “cash only” listings or take advantage of bank or tax foreclosure sales? How do they buy properties with built-in equity and create even more equity by fixing the property up? How do they utilize renters to pay off their loan in the long run? How do get money back out of the house so they can buy a 2nd, 3rd, or 10th investment property? Commonly referred to as the BRRRR Method, Northwest Private Lending specializes in helping clients Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat this process to build consistent income and wealth in real estate investment.
