<h2>Construction Loans</h2>
Construction Loans are a great resource for real estate investors who are purchasing or own properties that need extensive construction or renovation. Where traditional banks won’t finance loans for distressed properties, we do! At Northwest Private Lending we see Construction Loan as a means to improve and revitalize our community while helping borrowers achieve their investment goals!

<h2>Is a Construction Loan right for me?</h2>
Building a new home or renovating an existing one can be time-consuming and complex. Zoning, permits, and delays can cause your project to take longer than expected. Unlike most construction lenders, Northwest Private Lending never charges extension fees. With our interest-only payments of 1% per month, you can keep your loan with us for as long as you need to finish and sell the project.
