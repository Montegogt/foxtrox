<dd>I bought this car for $1800(too much) in Eastern Washington in 1991 (the start of my junior year in high school). I had nothing but trouble for about the first year. I spent over $3000 trying to get it to run right and it also need new breaks and tires. I had to spent so much because I did not know a lot about cars and so I had to take it to a shop each time something was wrong. The car still kept breaking down. Finally the oil pump stopped working and then my  \
engine seized up. It would have cost an additional $2000+ to have it rebuilt. I did some research and found out if I could fix it myself it would cost around $900 + a few weeks of my time. With some help from some friends and books, I did it and it ran great. I kept the car for a few years after that and had no  \
engine problems.<br>\
\
<dd>I finally decided to sell the car and get something newer and with better gas mileage. A little while after I sold it I was missing it. I liked having a  \
Hot Rod to play with. For a few years I had a 1970 Chevelle. I played with that for awhile then I thought it would be nice to have some extra money so I sold that too. Soon after I had to have another toy. I got a good deal for a 1969 Chevelle(only $500 and it ran). I only had that for a few months and people were begging me to sell it to them. I finally took a 1981 Blazer 4X4 for an even trade. I wanted a 4X4 for a while but could not afford it. Now I had one but I still loved playing with Hot Rods and so when I had some extra money, I went to find another. <br>\
\
<dd>I found a '73 Montego GT for sale in the paper for $900. I thought that was a bit strange because it was a rare car and to find another one in the same  \
area was a bit of a surprize. I found out it was the exact same car I owned earlier. It has been five years since I saw it last. It was in bad shape. It was  \
thrashed on. The new wheels, stereo, CD player and Holly carb that I had on it were gone. The car has been parked in a back yard for over two years. After  \
some work it finally started. The owners settled for $700 and towed it to my house. I cleaned it up, added new wheels, tires, carb and gave it a good  \
tune-up. Now it runs great again. <br>\
\
<dd>I kept the car for about eight more years but after moving to a Oregon for a job change, the car was hard to insure because it needed its own insurance  \
(unlike in Washington, I was able to have a broadform insurance and it would insure me on any car I drove). Because of this, I could not drive the car much  \
so it just sat in my garage for about six of the eight years. I would sneak is out once in awhile for a quick ride or show it off at a car show. But with the lack of time, money and know-how, I never did much else with the car.<br>\
\
<dd>I still loved the car and 49% of me wanted to keep the car but the other 51% knew it might be best to sell it and move on. I felt bad that the car was  \
just sitting there and if left up to me, nothing would happen to it but I felt it deserved to be fixed up. The interior needed a lot of work and the exterior needed a little patch work and a good paint job.<br>\
\
<dd>So the car was sold to a 16 year old (about the age when I first got it). His Grandfather also has an older Ford that he takes to car shows. So they  \
thought this would be a good project for them to work together on. I am glad it went to a home that looks like it would get the attention it deserves. Who  \
know, maybe I will be in the market again and will find it again.<br>\
