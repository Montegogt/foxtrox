descript=Skippy past away Friday August 14, 2009. He was suffering form back and hip problems and intestinal complications. Due to his older age of 16 years old, with surgery, recovery would be long and painful and still have a low chance of working. I did not want him to suffer anymore so with a heavy heart we said our goodbyes and now he can run freely again with all his past friends that he has played with over the many years. Skippy has touched many and will be dearly missed.
