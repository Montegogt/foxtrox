<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=Vehicle_Familiarization></A>Vehicle 
Familiarization</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Before you can safely point your wheels at the great beyond 
you need to be familiar with your vehicle, and take some precautions. You need 
to be able to answer the following questions:</FONT> 
<DL>
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>What is your ground clearance?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>How big a rock can you drive over without worrying about 
  it hitting something tender, like a gas tank?</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Is everything strapped down?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>If you roll, you don't want to get smoked in the head by 
  your toolbox. Is the battery restrained? If the battery jumps out of its 
  housing it can short against the hood, or another engine component, causing 
  big grief.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>What is your approach angle?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>If your bumper hits the slope before your wheels do 
  you'll have to come at it from an angle.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Similarly, what is your departure angle?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>If you exceed your departure angle then your rear bumper 
  will hang up on the hill and your rear wheels will leave the ground.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Where are your differentials?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>Drivers side? In the middle? This is important to 
  consider when you're going over obstacles.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Can your engine run at an angle?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>If it's carbureted, a steep grade can drown it post 
  haste. Fuel injected vehicles generally handle steep grades better. Diesels 
  and cylinder-injected gas trucks can pretty much run upside down without 
  dying.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Does your vehicle have a high center of 
  gravity?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>A high center of gravity makes it more susceptible to 
  tipping and rolling? Most jeep-like vehicles share this fault to various 
  degrees.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Do you have full wheel travel without hitting the 
  fenders?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>If you have monster meats on your truck, it's quite 
  possible that before the axle hits the bump-stop the tire hits the fender. 
  Jack up one front wheel high enough for the axle to hit the bump-stop and run 
  your hand around the tire to see if it's hitting anything. Now turn the wheel 
  full to the left and check. Now turn it to the right. If it hits anything then 
  you have to decide whether you want to tear up your tires or not by doing 
  serious off-roading. Check a rear wheel, too.</FONT> 
  <DT><I><FONT face=Arial>Does your vehicle have a big, long 6' whip antenna 
  that's going to injure a bystander or spotter?</FONT></I> 
  <DD><FONT face=Arial>Long whip antennas aren't even <I>allowed</I> on some 
  trails due to the damage to the environment that they can inflict.</FONT> 
</DD></DL>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=Safety_Check></A>Safety Check</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Now is the time to consider whether any of your fluids are 
low. Got enough power steering fluid? Enough oil? Enough coolant? How about 
windshield washer fluid? Have your brakes been checked fairly recently, or might 
you need to replace the pads/shoes? If you're traveling in a group at night, 
it's worth checking your taillights. Even alone at night you want headlights and 
reversing lights that work.</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=Safety_Gear></A>Safety Gear</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The amount of safety gear that you need will depend on 
several factors. The first is how hard-core the off-roading is that you're 
doing, the second is how remote an area you're going to, and the third is based 
on the climate of the area you're going to.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When I'm just booting around in my back field I don't bother 
taking much. If I get stuck or broke, I just walk back home and get the tractor. 
If, however, I was doing a four-day solo enduro through Death Valley, I would be 
taking significant precautions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you're traveling as one vehicle in a party, then the 
danger is obviously not so acute. You can get a lift back home with someone else 
and come back with spare parts later (hoping against hope that no unscrupulous 
type finds your truck in the meantime).</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Minimum_Gear></A>Minimum Gear</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This is the stuff that should be kept in the truck at all 
times. Add to it when you're doing more serious off-roading.</FONT>

<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Remote_Gear></A>Remote Gear</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you're going back of beyond (especially by yourself) then 
you really should take precautions. Any mechanical breakdown that you can't fix 
or jury-rig could leave you stranded. Don't scrimp on the navigational equipment 
if it's unfamiliar turf; you can't always count on your St. Christopher 
medallion to get you home on time. 8-)</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>In this day of trail closures and EPA pressures, it is more 
crucial than ever to tread lightly. To this end, I have assembled some 
guidelines divided by terrain type.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=General_tips_on_Treading_Lightly></A>General tips 
on Treading Lightly</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>None of us want to see our trails closed down. Few of us 
want to see our environment destroyed, either. It is the duty of all off-roaders 
to consider the ramifications of leaving a beer can, or shredded spare tire 
lying on the trail. Would you want a news crew with their cameras catching 
<I>your</I> garbage and suggesting that <I>all</I> off-roaders are insensitive 
to environmental issues? It has happened before, and it will happen again. Don't 
let it be <I>your</I> mess.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Forest></A>Forest</FONT></H4>
<DL>
  <DT><FONT face=Arial>Don't cut down trees, and try not to tear branches off 
  while driving.</FONT> 
  <DT><FONT face=Arial>Your vision is limited by the trees; don't go flying 
  around a bend only to smash into a disabled vehicle, or run over a 
  hiker.</FONT> 
  <DT><FONT face=Arial>Keep to the trail. If the mud is too deep to get through, 
  then you shouldn't be on the trail in the first place. If everyone cuts a new 
  set of ruts, the trail starts to look like a battlefield. Use a winch to get 
  through.</FONT> </DT></DL>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Right_Of_Way></A>Right Of Way</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The right of way on a trail is basically like that on the 
ocean. Generally, everyone just stays out of everyone else's way. Pass on the 
right, veer right in head-to-head situations, etc. If there's only room for one 
vehicle at a time, then channel rules take over and the more maneuverable 
vehicle should make way. If it's a situation where only one vehicle can pass at 
a time, then the drivers must decide amongst themselves who goes first. Usually 
this amounts to just a 'waving through', but sometimes it requires a bit of 
discussion on foot.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the event that you find yourself head-to-head with 
someone on a single line, so that one person has to back up or move aside to let 
the other pass, the more capable vehicle should get out of the way, as the less 
capable vehicle might not be able to make it back on the trail.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Sometimes these rules don't work so well; if the guy driving 
a stock Sammy knows his stuff he can easily outmaneuver a modified Jeep driven 
by someone who isn't really familiar with off-road situations. The primary thing 
to remember is that bad things happen when people don't know what's going on; 
make sure there is clear communication, and the other driver <I>knows</I> that 
it's your turn to go.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When two vehicles meet on a grade, the vehicle traveling 
uphill <I>should</I> have the right of way, as it is much more difficult to get 
going again when you're pointing uphill as opposed to downhill, and backing up 
uphill is safer than backing up downhill (as long as it's done smoothly so as 
not to stress the front axle).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When two vehicle meet head to head, they <I>may</I> need to 
pass on the left. When there is a sharp shoulder dropping to a deep ditch, for 
instance, you need to drive with the drop at the driver's side so that you can 
see more clearly where the edge is.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Again, these 'right of way' rules are general at best! 
Unless both parties know what's going on, an accident can happen. Make sure 
there is communication. If needed, get out of the truck and chat for a while. 
Maybe the rules have to be bent to avoid a truck being bent. You can't just chug 
on assuming that the other truck will move just because you are supposed to have 
the right of way.</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=General_OR_Driving_Hints></A>General OR Driving 
Hints</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Friction is your friend. With friction, you can move. 
Without it, you are stuck.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>There are two kinds of friction; static, and dynamic. Static 
friction is the kind you have when your wheel surface is not moving relative to 
the surface you are driving on (i.e. when you are not skidding). Dynamic 
friction is what you have when you <I>are</I> skidding. Static friction is much 
more powerful than dynamic friction. It is for this reason that threshold 
braking will stop you quicker than just stomping on the brake pedal and skidding 
to a stop. So the key in the vast majority of situations is to try very hard not 
to spin your wheels.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Don't drive with your thumbs wrapped around the steering 
wheel. Even if you have power steering it's possible for the wheels to fall into 
a rut or something that will crank the steering wheel to one side, and possibly 
break a thumb. Nasty.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Driving off-road isn't like driving on-road; you can't just 
choose a line and insist upon it; the truck will let you know what it wants to 
do. Keep it more or less where you want to be and just 'suggest' directions to 
it. Anyone who rides a horse knows what I'm talking about.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial>"Drive as slowly as possible, and as fast as 
  necessary."</FONT> </BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Arial>Andy Philpot</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Don't straddle rocks or they'll smoke your differentials; 
ride the wheels over them to raise everything out of harm's way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Ditches and ridges should be crossed at an angle (like 
railroad tracks) to keep you from getting bogged down when both front or back 
wheels drop into the ditch.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Be wary of water crossings. What you don't know <I>can</I> 
hurt you. See the section on water crossings below.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Airing down your tires to 15psi or so will increase your 
contact patch and increase friction. Don't do it unless you have some way to 
re-inflate your tires, though. In some technical rock-crawling situations people 
will air down to next to nothing (2 pounds or so), but I wouldn't advise this 
for the uninitiated as you could blow a bead.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Maintaining speed on bumpy terrain can be very difficult 
because the pitching of the truck throws your foot (via momentum) into the gas 
pedal, causing the truck to surge, causing <I>more</I> momentum, causing your 
foot to get thrown <I>harder</I> into the gas pedal... It's ugly. There are two 
regular solutions: the good way, and the sort-of-works-most-of-the-time way. The 
good way is to have a hand throttle. A hand throttle will keep your vehicle 
moving as smoothly as possible. The other way is to keep the side of your foot 
planted against the transmission mound, operating the gas pedal only with the 
ball of the foot. This keeps your foot planted, so it can't go flailing into the 
gas pedal. At least, not as much.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you drive a late-model truck with air conditioning, it 
might be worth shutting the AC off when you're in a tight crawling situation, as 
the AC compressor will kick in at odd moments and cause the idle speed to jump, 
which is at best a pain, and at worst could pitch you off of your line and drop 
you on a rock.</FONT></P><FONT face=Arial>Some hints from Chris Siano:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT face=Arial>Driving posture is something I've never seen printed fully 
  anywhere. Things like, seat up, sit a little closer to the steering wheel, 
  thumbs out of the wheel, foot resting on the transmission hump to keep vehicle 
  from surging as it bounces over the trail. Seat belt!</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial>Prepare for getting stuck. If you and your buddy are going 
  out, and you have an old CJ and he has a Cummins Dodge, there is no way you 
  are going to pull his truck out of bumper deep mud. Therefore, don't get into 
  bumper deep mud. If the strap is 30' long and the mud is 200', there is no way 
  you can pull anyone out of the middle. I guess, the best way to sum it up is 
  to be sure to look before you leap. It only takes one big stuck and a 4x4 
  wrecker or tractor extraction to realize how important this is.</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT face=Arial>Lastly, a new driver really needs to know the size of his 
  vehicle. If you don't know where the tires are, you can't put them on the 
  rocks. Only takes an hour in an empty parking lot with some cones to learn how 
  wide your rig is, and how tight you can turn it. This is especially useful in 
  full size trucks as you can't see anything on the passenger front any closer 
  than about 10 feet away. This time spent can easily save lots of time and $$ 
  in damages to a new truck.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This point about knowing where your tires are is <I>very</I> 
important. Most people use points on their hood to estimate where their tires 
are. This works fine as long as your head is always in more or less the same 
place. This means you should have a standard off-road seat location and 
seat-back angle and <I>stick</I> to it. With your head in the same place all the 
time, you'll be able to judge your tire location much more 
effectively.</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=Getting_Unstuck></A>Getting Unstuck</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Everyone gets stuck. You ever seen a tank winch? Well I 
have. Even they get stuck. So how do you get <I>un</I>stuck? Lots of 
ways.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Winches></A>Winches</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The easiest, fastest way most of the time is to use a winch. 
See the section in the FAQ on "Which Winch Is Winchiest?" for info on the pros 
and cons on the different types.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>With a winch, a snatch block (a pulley with a hook on it), a 
tree strap (to keep from maiming the local flora), and <B>some leather 
gloves</B>, you can get yourself out pretty quick from just about 
anything.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Normally you just need to single-line your way out. Just 
switch the winch to freewheel, pull out the line to the nearest big tree, throw 
the tree strap around it, hook up, and pull yourself out. If the winch stalls, 
then hook in the snatch block (when using a snatch block, hook the end of the 
winch line to your tow hook, not to the winch mounting itself, or you might tear 
the winch right off your truck).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you're winching someone else out of the mud, and your 
truck keeps skidding towards the vehicle you're winching, then you need to 
either put good-sized blocks under the wheels (like SureClaws) or attach your 
truck to an anchor (like a tree) but connect the line from the anchor to the end 
of your vehicle that has the winch on it, otherwise you might end up physically 
stretching or twisting your truck frame. Bad stuff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you keep stalling the winch, even with a snatch block, 
then you have to reduce the workload. Try putting chunks of wood in front of the 
wheels to act like ramps to keep the wheels from plowing deep furrows in the 
mud. If you're winching over rocks, then try piling up smaller rocks to make 
ramps. Hopefully you won't have to unload your truck.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you've had trouble with your winch not being powerful 
enough (i.e. your wife gave you a 3000pound winch for Christmas and it's the 
first official acknowledgment of off-roading she's ever made and you just 
<I>know</I> that you can't take it back) then a last-resort possibility is to 
have extra snatch blocks. With three snatch blocks you can set up a block and 
tackle that will give your winch 4X its normal power. This is good, unless the 
tow hook to which you attached the block and tackle can't handle it and tears 
itself off the truck. Then it's bad. In addition, you won't have more than about 
20 feet of pulling capability, because the wire will be doubled up around the 
pulleys so many times. Whenever you are using a winch of any variety it pays to 
lay a coat, sleeping bag, or other largish, soft object over the line, so that 
if the line snaps it will be less likely to be really dangerous.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Winch_Alternatives></A>Winch 
Alternatives</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>There are several things out there that aren't winches, but 
are supposed to do the same job. One is a Hi-Lift jack (HLJ) or similar jack, 
and another is a come-along ratchet hoist. An HLJ is meant to be able to pull 
7000 pounds or so (says the weight rating on the box) and the mechanical 
advantage is so high that it doesn't feel <I>too</I> scary to use it. If you're 
using an HLJ as a winch then lay the jack right on the ground with the handle 
pointing upwards, that way you can put a foot or something on the end of the 
I-beam to keep it from lifting when you're trying to lever the jack 
handle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>A come-along is a different animal, indeed. It has a short 
handle (less than a foot long) and gives you significantly less mechanical 
advantage. They are usually rated only a few thousand pounds when double-lined 
(i.e while using a snatch block). They way they creak and groan while you're 
using them, standing 10 inches away from the thinnest cable ever seen on a 
winch-like object scares me to death. I don't like them, but they can save you 
if you have nothing else. Definitely use the coat trick when dealing with these. 
Due to the short length of them, they don't stay parallel to the line of force 
very well, so it's very frustrating to use them (they wobble and pitch when 
you're trying to work the lever). I don't like them, but I must admit that I 
have one in my pickup truck. Just in case. I keep an HLJ in my 'cruiser, so I 
don't need one in that. The one benefit of a come-along over an HLJ is that the 
come-along will pull for 20 feet or so, whereas the HLJ will pull for less than 
4' at a time (limited by bar length; could also be 3' or 5' depending on jack 
model). To use an HLJ as a winch requires blocks, or some other way to keep the 
truck from losing ground while you're resetting the jack. To be fair, there are 
some come-along models out there that are pretty tough. If you get one that's 
rated to 4000 pounds or so, then it should be able to actually pull you out of a 
bad situation. If you plan to use an HLJ as a winch alternative, then make sure 
you have hardware on hand to do it; you can't thread a 3" wide tow strap through 
the little hole in the jack. Get a clevis that fits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Those ladder-like things for ice and snow can be a blessing, 
or a curse. A couple of those beneath your wheels will usually get you going 
again. For a couple of feet. Then you have to stop and pick them up. If you're 
using these, put it in granny low, let the engine just idle, and feather in the 
clutch. You don't want to spin the wheels on these things because it is possible 
to send them flying into whatever is in their path (other vehicle, the underside 
of <I>your</I> vehicle, you...)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Regular ladder-type pads don't work in mud (they just sink) 
but they're great on ice and slicked snow. For mud you need something with a 
semi-solid surface that will stay on top of the mud. You might think that an old 
ski- doo track would be great. They almost are. In shallow stuff they work 
great, but in really deep stuff they let the tire push them down, and your truck 
just ends up having to drive 'uphill' against the mud. They still work, but not 
as well.</FONT></P>

incidents which could have had a very nasty ending if it weren't for tons of

that of any winch or conventional pulling - even if the towing vehicle is on 
very slippery ground.<BR><BR>Basically all you do is</FONT>

</LI></OL><FONT face=Arial><B>IMPORTANT</B> tips that may keep you and others 
alive:</FONT> 
<OL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>The drivers in the two vehicles <EM>MUST MUST MUST 
  MUST</EM> wear seat belts and certified crash helmets.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>The towing points on both vehicles must be <B>very</B> 
  robust. The force generated by snatch pulling can be of the order of several 
  tons - up to about four times the weight of the towing vehicle (even if only 
  for a few seconds). If you are not sure about the strength of the tow points 
  you are inviting disaster.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>The rope should be tied directly to the towing point - 
  <EM>NO</EM> metal fittings such as eyes or shackles may be used.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>The vehicles must both have roll cages (real ones not

  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Everybody else (spectators photographers and whoever) 
  <EM>MUST</EM> stay at a distance of at least twice the length of the rope 
  being used. If anybody insists on staying (perhaps to take photos or 
  something) <EM>DO NOT PROCEED</EM> until he gets out of the way or you are 
  sure that he's Bill Gates.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Use decent knots to tie the rope. The knot should be as

  best knot to use. It is important that the knot be as small as 
  possible.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>If at all possible avoid snatch towing a small light 
  vehicle (eg. a Sammy) with a much heavier vehicle (i.e. anything :-)</FONT>

  <EM>AVOID AVOID AVOID</EM> chains, steel ropes, Kevlar, Carbon fibre, 
  'pre-tensioned' or non-synthetic ropes. The rope should be Nylon or a similar 
  material which can stretch to almost twice its length without breaking and 
  must have a breaking strength in excess of 25 tons.</FONT> </LI></OL><FONT 
face=Arial>So what exactly is so dangerous about it?<BR>What we are doing here 
is changing the momentum of the towing vehicle into energy stored in the tow 
rope. Its like we are using the towing trucks engine to 'wind-up' the rope. What 
this means is that all the energy that your fire-breathing V8 has produced in 
those seconds of acceleration is now <EM>stored in the rope</EM> ready to be 
released at an instant if something goes wrong. What we want is for that energy 
to pull the bogged vehicle out of its mud-hole but what if it doesn't do 
it?</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>The main dangers in order of magnitude are:</FONT> 
<OL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>The worst that can happen is that the towing point (or 
  indeed a chunk of chassis) of one of the vehicles gets torn off. If this 
  happens, the piece torn off will shoot off (accelerated by tons of tension in 
  the rope) and can easily reach speeds of almost 500mph (yes, five hundred 
  miles per hour) depending on the size of the chunk extracted. I can leave it 
  to your imagination what happens if said chunk hits someone.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>If too much force is used at once, the bogged vehicle may 
  come loose with the rope still having lots of stored energy to spare. This 
  stored energy then makes your newly de-bogged vehicle accelerate faster than 
  an F-15 on steroids and literally go airborne and come crashing down (most 
  likely onto the towing vehicle - been there done that). The important thing is 
  that you always start gently and <I>gradually</I> use more force at each 
  attempt.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>The rope may break. This usually happens where it is in 
  contact with the tow point. This results in a missile launch similar to when 
  the tow point breaks except that this time only the rope is flying. That is 
  why the knot should be as small as possible. A messy multiple knot will easily 
  smash through a steel body panel at that speed. The smaller the knot, the less 
  the damage it will cause. Having said that, even the rope itself can be lethal 
  but you have made sure that everybody is far away. The drivers of the vehicles 
  are not normally in danger since the rope will get tangled in the vehicle and 
  also lose most of its energy before reaching the driver. One may still get 
  injured if extremely unlucky however.</FONT> </LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Horror stories:<BR><BR>I have seen two near accidents caused 
by improper snatch towing which could have had a very nasty ending.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The first instance involved two Land-Rovers about six years 
ago. No amount of winching would make the bogged landy budge. Also digging was 
impossible as the mud was too fluid and Hi-Lifting impossible. So they went for 
snatch pulling. Even the most violent acceleration brought no results. They then 
decided to use two ropes (to double the length) with the result that the towing 
Landy reached speeds in excess of 40mph!! before the rope slack was taken up. 
Just as the Landy started to loose the battle against the increasing tension of 
the rope an appalling impact and what sounded like a rifle shot was heard. The 
tow rope seemed to have vanished. What had happened was that the towing point of 
the stricken Landy was pulled right out of the chassis and catapulted at awesome 
speed towards the towing landy. It went right through the rear door, the 
bulkhead and through the front windscreen, scattering bits of glass and aluminum 
all over the place. The towing point had actually passed within a few inches of 
the drivers head!! He was wearing a helmet but I doubt what protection that can 
afford against a 6 lb supersonic towook!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>So what did they do wrong? The worst thing was to use too 
much force without thought about the consequences. One must stop and think about 
an alternative before just applying more and more brute force.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The other incident involved a Land-rover de-bogging a Sammy. 
What happened this time was simply that maximum brute force was used right away. 
The Landrover accelerated about 20 feet to approx 20Mph before the rope started 
tensioning. All of a sudden the Sammy catapulted out of the ground flew a 
distance of about 25 feet and came crashing into the roof of the Landy just 
above the level of the tailgate. The only thing that prevented the driver of the 
Landy from getting killed was the substantial rollcage. What went wrong here was 
very simply that maximum brute force was applied first time. There was probably 
four times as much energy in the rope as was needed to debog the 
'Zuki.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The moral of it all: snatch towing is a great way of 
recovering otherwise unrecoverable vehicles. I have seen many otherwise 
unrecoverable vehicles (even my mog) recovered by snatch pulling. If done with 
care, it is safe but if not can be lethal. Always try winching, HiLifting and 
digging before snatch pulling.</FONT></P><FONT face=Arial>[ How's <I>that</I>

<P><FONT face=Arial>So we've heard what the process can do, and we've heard a 
whole lot about what can go wrong. Bottom line? If nothing else works, this 
might, but be darn careful if you try it. It's really not that scary at low 
speeds (10mph max). Here is a table supplied by Guy Hammer that tells you how

<P><FONT face=Arial>Note: The tow hooks I have seen for sale are only rated for 
10,000 lbs. As best have I have been able to determine, the two 1/2" bolts that 
hold them to your frame could break at 14,000-15000 lbs. Having a tow hook 
imbedded in the back of your truck (or skull) could ruin your entire day! (And 
no, I don't know anyone crazy enough to hit the end of a 12" strap at 50 
MPH!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>From this we can see that a 3,000 pound vehicle at only 10 
miles per hour can apply more power than most of the electric winches on the 
market. A very powerful tug, indeed. High speeds make for a tremendous amount of 
power. Always always always start with small tugs at low speeds. There's no 
sense in tearing the towing points right off of the vehicles. The previously 
mentioned tug by the 3,000 pound vehicle at 10mph will apply as much force as 
the stock towing points in many new vehicles are designed to take (the wire loop 
tow points found on many newer vehicles are an example).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The reality of the situation is that many people use snatch 
pulling as their primary method of extraction, and think nothing of it. It 
<I>can</I> be safe if done properly at reasonable speeds. I use snatch pulling 
to pull people out of ditches. When you're using it, don't be in a hurry to use 
more power; use a whole bunch of small pulls rather than a huge brute tug. I 
pulled a minivan from the bottom of a 6' ditch while I was on glare ice by using 
small tugs, and lots of them. I gained maybe an inch each tug. It adds up, and 
eventually he came out. Try to get a rhythm going so that you aren't in gear 
when you hit the end of the strap; rather start going and let the inertia of the 
vehicle pull you forward, then you will recoil on the strap and you can just 
stay in a forward gear and use the clutch to 'bounce' on the end of the strap. 
If I had to shift into reverse for every tug I'd <I>still</I> be tugging away at 
the guy I pulled out of the ditch last night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>This is, of course, a nice, mannered discussion of the

useful institution. That being said, however, I would still rather do without 
them. I tend to be a solitary in my hobbies; I drive off in a random direction 
for a couple weeks of rough camping, and my rig is really intended to get me to 
and from potential camping/climbing spots, more so than it is just an outlet for 
a rock-crawling addiction. I also feel that using spotters frequently might be 
habit-forming; and in a situation where there is no spotter available you might 
do a worse job of it because of your anxiety due to not having your crutch. 
Still, when you're doing highly technical rock-crawling, you don't have much 
choice but to use a spotter. I put it in the 'necessary evil' 
category.</FONT></P>

granny low and stomp on the gas. This, is <I>not</I> the way to do 
it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>There are two forces that can get you over a hill: momentum, 
and friction. For small hills and bumps, you can safely rely on momentum to get

to rely at least partially on friction.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>You need to have the truck in as high a gear as possible in 
order to reduce the chances of the wheels spinning. In granny-low, you'll just 
spin out and slide down (unless you can idle up the hill). Try the hill first in 
your middle gear (2nd for 3-speeds, 3 for 5-speeds) and see what 
happens.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you do start to spin out, ease off the throttle, and

then hit the brakes and clutch to hold yourself steady, shift into reverse, and 
let go of all pedals. Let the engine do the braking. <I>DON'T</I> use the brakes 
going down a hill, or you will likely lose static friction and you might start

<P><FONT face=Arial>Short steep hills can be mentally unsettling, because you

great enough. In these cases you should approach the hill at a 45 degree angle 
or so (more if necessary) and as <I>soon</I> as the tire closer to the hill has 
a bite on it, crank the wheels into the hill so that you will turn up the 
hill.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>You want to avoid having one side of the vehicle higher than 
the other.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>You should avoid backing up a steep hill. It puts a lot of 
stress on the front axle, and specifically the birfield joints (found in Land 
Cruisers, etc.). It's not too hard to break a birfield backing up a steep hill 
if you goose the throttle, especially if you have a front locker, and then 
you're <I>stuck</I>. If you must back up a steep hill, do it 
smoothly.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Steep_Decents></A>Steep </FONT><FONT 
face=Arial>Descents</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>These can be easy or hard. The rule against using brakes on 
a decent applies here. Use compression braking only. If the surface is firm, 
just steep, then select granny low, and go down. Don't touch those brakes if you 
can help it. If you must, then keep the clutch engaged, that way you can't lock 
the wheels. If the surface isn't firm, then the selection of a gear becomes more 
tricky. Too low a gear might not let the wheels turn fast enough to maintain 
static friction, but too high a gear will have you careening down the hill 
faster than you want to go. Your best bet usually (experience will teach) is to 
go with granny low, and keep your mitt on the hand throttle. If you start to 
skid forward, yard on the hand throttle to increase wheel speed and regain 
traction. If you don't have a hand throttle then be very careful with the gas 
pedal, as you don't want your foot to bounce into the gas and get you going 
faster than prudence dictates. Don't try to change gears going down a hill. If 
the situation starts looking grim half way down a hill, and you just 
<I>can't</I> keep the wheels spinning fast enough to maintain static friction, 
then you may have to use the clutch. If there is open space at the bottom of the 
hill (so you're not going to smack a tree or something) then pushing the clutch 
won't cause you much grief if the surface is relatively smooth. Remember, 
though, that high speeds on rough surfaces are dangerous, and the vibration will 
cause the whole world to blur at the edges, and you won't be able to tell where 
you're going. If you lose your line down the hill, you might hit a bump, the 
wheels might bounce to one side, the truck could end up turning sharply, and you 
could roll down the hill. Slow is better. The general rule with hills is 
"Straight up, and straight down." Turning on a hill is to be avoided where 
possible.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Stalling_on_a_Steep_Grade></A>Stalling on a Steep 
Grade</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This is a definite hassle. It never occurred to me to put 
this section in, being blessed with an injected diesel that will run upside down 
if I want it do, but some carburetors don't like steep grades, and may very well 
stall on longer ones. Here's what to do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>[From the nimble fingers of Guy Hammer comes:]</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>All right, I have a manual transmission, power brakes, and 
my carb likes to flood out on steep angles. I'm perched way up on the side of 
this hill with both feet occupied with clutch and brake, and the engine is dead. 
<B>Now what</B>??!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Number one priority is not to lose the power assist in the 
brakes at this point. Do <B>not</B> pump or release the brakes. If you do, and 
exhaust the reserve capacity of the power booster you won't be able to hold your 
rig from rolling back even if you use both feet! The parking brake won't hold it 
either!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>[Ed. note: Guy is about to get into a discussion about how 
to coerce a sticky gearbox into shifting into reverse. Most gearboxes aren't 
going to need this kind of treatment, but you should try shutting off your truck 
on a <I>small</I> hill to simulate this stalled- climb situation and see if 
yours is the sticky kind (like a T18).]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Number two priority is to get the trans in reverse. If it 
won't go just keep stirring the stick between various forward gears and reverse 
until you get it to drop in. If that doesn't work, release the clutch 
(<B>not</B> the brake) and bump the starter while pulling it into reverse. Once 
in reverse <B>now</B> you can release the brake. If your rig doesn't have low 
enough gears to hold you on the hill, at least the engine turning will help 
rebuild vacuum in the brake booster. If the gears <I>do</I> hold you, hit the 
starter and back on down the hill. At this point if the engine restarts, fine, 
just let it idle you down.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you get crossed up backing down the hill you may have no 
choice but to try and re-start the engine and try to pull forward a bit. Stop 
the rig by releasing the starter (or with the brakes if the gears won't hold it. 
<B>Be careful</B> with the brakes!) With the clutch and brakes applied, shift 
into whatever forward gear works best for climbing in your rig. At this point 
it's useful to know the "racers three-step". Left foot on clutch, right toe on 
brake, right heel mashing gas. (on my rig anyway.) If you can get the engine to 
catch, that's half the battle. Rev it a few times to clear the flooding as much 
as possible, and then simultaneously release the brake and clutch, mash the gas, 
cross your fingers and hold your breath. (might want to practice this before you 
get caught on Lions Back ;) With luck this might buy you a few feet or even get 
you on up and over the hill.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>[Here endeth the lesson.]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Basically what you're doing is letting the compression of 
your stalled engine act as a brake to slow your journey down the hill. Because 
the engine is physically being turned over (though it isn't actually running) 
you will get some power back in your brakes (because the pump is running). You 
can now use your brakes to slow your descent.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The second-to-last-ditch attempt thing to try is to leave 
your truck in first gear, ignore the brakes, and use the clutch as a brake. 
There is a built-in psychological aspect to this, because you're used to pushing 
in the clutch to stop, and in this case you need to <I>let</I> <I>go</I> of the 
clutch to stop. Irritating little problem. As long as you are in 4WD you will 
have four wheel braking using this method, so it will hold you on the hill, as 
long as there is traction. Hard on the clutch, though.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you are 10 feet away from the crest of the hill then you 
might want to try the absolute-last-ditch thing, and that is to put the truck in 
first gear and let the starter drive you up the hill. This isn't inordinately 
hard on the starter as long as you don't run it for longer than 10 or 15 seconds 
at a time. When the 10-15 seconds is up, just shut off the key and the engine 
will hold the truck steady (because you're not touching the clutch or the 
brakes). After you give the starter a good 5 minutes to cool, then do it again. 
Sooner or later either your battery will be dead, or you'll be at the top of the 
hill. This only works on an oldish truck that doesn't have an interlock that 
keeps you from working the starter with the truck in gear.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>It has been suggested to me that you <I>shouldn't</I> get 
out of your truck on a steep grade unless your seatbelts are of the type that 
can be pulled out again on a grade (many lock on a grade, and once it retracts 
you can't pull it out again until the truck is on level ground). Land Cruisers 
of my vintage suffer this 'feature', and it's a pain. The best you can do is to 
try to use something like the vise grips from the toolbox (if you can reach it 
with your belt on) to keep the belt from retracting when you take it 
off.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>This section has been replaced by an article by Runar 
Sigurjonsson (apologies for the lack of punctuation). The article was written by 
him, but it was heavily edited by myself as English is not Runar's first 
language. Anything in square brackets is an addition by myself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This is the way we cross the glacial rivers [in Iceland] and 
maybe this does not fit into what you were thinking about. Those glacial rivers 
change regularly, they can be passable in the morning but not in the afternoon 
[due to melt water, caused by the sun], but then maybe in a different 
place.....:-( Crossing rivers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Rivers and your truck:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Water is one of your truck's biggest enemies. If water gets 
into a gasoline engine, it will be greatly damaged. If water gets into a Diesel 
engine it will be destroyed. The two most important parts to protect are the 
air-intake and the electronic ignition system.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The ignition system in newer vehicles is usually very tight 
and need not be worried about. In older vehicles it can help to spray some 
water-repelling sprays, but they often make the ignition very dirty.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The air-intake is the route water can get into your engine. 
If that happens, you are in deep [trouble]. If you are lucky you only need to 
dry your engine, if not, start looking for a new engine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In newer vehicles the air is usually fed in from two places, 
inside the front fender and from around the exhaust-pipes. The fender is well 
protected from splashes but if you drive to fast the vehicle will make a wave in 
front and raise the water level inside the fender.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The best place for a air-intake is on the roof or feeding 
the air through the firewall from inside the truck.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The weight of your truck has big effect on its river 
crossing abilities and the height up under the body also. As soon as the body 
goes into the water the weight that is sitting on the tires is greatly reduced, 
making it easier for the current to push the vehicle its way. For example if 
your vehicle weighs 3300 pounds and the body-tub is 7x5 feet and it sinks one 
foot into water the weight on the tires is reduced to only 1220 pounds [assuming 
no leakage of water into the tub].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>No precautions need to be taken for the exhaust system, 
there is no way water can get past the exhaust [as long as the engine is 
running].</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Where to cross:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>In general it is best to cross where the river is wide and 
has adequate current. Adequate current means that it is not as deep as where 
there is less current, and it also means that the bottom is more solid. [ If the 
river is a consistent 13 feet across, and one area has a faster current than 
another area, then that area with the faster current is shallower.]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The current carries with it mud and sand that it puts down 
where the current drops and that makes the bottom soft and dangerous.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Never cross in a place that cannot be waded. If the place is 
unknown to the driver he should examine it by wading over himself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>He needs to check how deep it is, how fast the current is, 
and how [firm] the bottom is. To wade in a safe manner the person should have a 
stick (the heavier the better) and face up the river, leaning on the stick, with 
slightly bent knees. This gives him the best stability. He should be tied to a 
rope that one person holds onto on the riverbank. It is very important that the 
end of the rope that is on the riverbank, is not tied to anything. If the person 
wading should fall, the one on the bank should run down the river at the same 
speed as the victim is floating and pull him to the riverbank. This way the 
effect of the current is eliminated and very little force is needed to pull the 
victim to the riverbank, your ten year old is probably strong enough for it. If 
the end on the riverbank is tied to something the current will push the victim 
down into the river possibly drowning the victim.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>[ Ed. note: I've had a long discussion with Runar about the 
'running down the bank' point because on this continent we are blessed with 
those tall green things with bark that make running down the riverbank quite 
difficult on occasion. My opinion has always been that the rope tied to you 
should be tied on the bank as well, but Runar has convinced me that even with 
the rope tied high under your armpits you will plane <I>down</I> into the river 
if the rope goes taut. I'm not sure where this leaves us. If there are no trees 
on the riverbank to impede running or snag the rope, then his method is by far 
the best, but in a forest probably the best method would be to have the person 
on the bank hold on to the rope and feed it out as necessary so that there is a 
line between you but there is little or no tension. It's a tough question, with 
no good answer. ]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Seeing another vehicle cross is often enough to see where to 
cross, but remember that it is often not best to go over at the same place in 
both directions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><I>Never</I> go over a big river without a buddy four 
wheeler in his/her truck.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Driving over:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>If the river is only hub deep there is usually no danger. 
Just cross in a slow manner, and remember that it could suddenly get a lot 
deeper.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Always drive in 1st-gear 4-wheeldrive low range (remember to 
lock the hubs) and be in that gear before you get into the river because 
shifting gears in a river is an emergency only. When you press the clutch pedal 
down, water can possibly get between the clutch-disk and the flywheel making it 
impossible to engage again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Drive slowly (1st-low at 1500-2000 rpm) over and try to 
drive down the river. That way the current will help to push the vehicle across 
and a wave will not be generated in front. If you drive up against the current a 
big wave will be in front adding to the chance of taking water into the 
air-intake. Besides that your vehicle may simply not have the power or traction 
to go up against the current (even if you have a 454).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In most cases the current will try to push the vehicle down 
the river and the rear end will be pushed faster. Be prepared to turn the front 
wheels in the direction of the "slide", as you would in other circumstances. If 
that is not enough, accelerate so the front tires can keep up with the rear 
tires. If that is still not enough (you should not have chosen this place!) and 
the vehicle turns, facing upstream, put it in reverse and try to reverse up to 
either bank.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Going forward is not an option in such 
circumstances.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Turn the headlights off. The sudden cooling of them can 
destroy the bulbs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Tying a rope to the hitch is a smart move. If things go in 
the worst way, it makes a rescue a lot easier.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Want to learn more? Take your mountain bike to a innocent, 
about knee deep river and experiment. That way you will get a better 
understanding of all the forces that the river puts on your vehicle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In case of an emergency:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Like I said before <B>never</B> cross a big river without 
some spare truck on the bank. If your vehicle stops halfway across and can't get 
any farther the first thing to do is to get the people to dry land. <B>Never</B> 
jump off of the truck on the upstream side, since the current can push you down 
under the truck and you could easily get stuck on some stuff in the frame and 
then nothing can save you. Try to get a rope to the shore and have the people 
there pull everyone over.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>To dry an engine:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>If your engine stalls from water, don't try to start it as 
that could make things worse. Have it pulled to dry land and then open the air 
cleaner. If there is water in it chances are that water got all the way into the 
engine block. If not, this is probably the blame of wet ignition. If water is in 
the air cleaner, remove the filter and all the spark plugs. Then try to start 
the engine. It will of course not run but the water inside will be pushed out of 
the spark plug holes. If it doesn't turn or turns with an awful sound, you are 
facing a big repair bill or the need for a new engine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Also check all lubricants for water. If water gets into the 
engine oil and you don't have any replacement oil, wait for an hour or so or 
until the oil and the water has separated, with the water lowest in the pan. 
Loosen the drain plug until the water flows out and when oil starts coming out, 
too, tighten it again. Drive to the <RM>next service station and have all 
lubricants changed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>[ End of article ]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Runar's article is quite complete, and pretty much 
overwrites everything I wrote previously. There are still a couple of points 
that I'd like to make:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial>Generally speaking, driving through water no higher than the 
top of the wheel rim is not a big problem, and just about any 4x4 will do it if 
the bottom surface is reasonably firm (packed sand, smooth-grade rocks, 
etc).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Any deeper than this, and you have to consider what will get 
dunked. Will you get water in your differentials? Will your radiator fan get 
purchase on the water and claw its way into the radiator? Will you douse an 
electrical component that won't like it? If you get the vehicle's computer wet 
it is <I>game</I> <I>over</I>! You will need a new computer ($$!), and a tow 
home.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Even if you can see the bottom of the water, you should 
investigate carefully where you're going to cross. Some slow-moving streams have 
an incredibly thick layer of crud on the bottom, something which Runar wouldn't 
have ever seen before (rivers in Iceland are pretty much all glacial, so they 
have strong currents, so no heavy mud layer) and what looks like the bottom of 
the stream might be just the top of a 3 foot deep layer of stinking 
ooze.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>A fast-moving stream is more reliable; the speed of the 
water carries soft stuff away. A sandy wash can usually be trusted as long as 
the sand surface is rippled (indicating currents at work). If the sand is 
smooth, it might just be the underwater equivalent of 'quicksand', and a good 
poking with a pole is in order to check the situation out. If you see pebbles on 
the surface of the river bottom then you are pretty safe driving on it. If it 
was quickstuff down there, then the pebbles would sink. Don't count on your 
vehicle being able to pull itself out if your front wheels fall off a shelf into 
deeper water. Unless you have a winch on the back of the vehicle, you're in 
trouble.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Point hints:</FONT> 
<OL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Be very careful of stream deltas (where they empty into a 
  lake) as they are often clogged deep with mud, and it's a wider area to cross. 
  In cases other than deltas, wider is often better because it indicates a 
  shallower section, but deltas are to be avoided!</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Consider the firmness of the banks of the stream. Are 
  they steep? Will they slide under the weight of the truck? Will you be able to 
  climb the other side?</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Don't blindly trust an assumed fording point where a 
  logging road crosses it; the road might have been used only by skidders, which 
  have huge 60" chevron-tread tractor tires on them.</FONT> </LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Arial>There has been some spirited debate regarding the question 
of whether to cross a fast river at a downstream angle as Runar suggests, or 
whether to go straight across. I have done significant mental exploration of the 
situation with my old physics and hydrodynamics texts, and done various 
experiments with model vehicles and moving water. What I have found out is 
this:</FONT> 
<OL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>This is not an issue unless the current is fast (at least 
  3mph/5kmh or so).</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>In water that doesn't reach the level of the 
  differential, the difference is very insignificant.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>In water that reaches the axles and differential but not 
  the body of the vehicle it is slightly better to be headed downstream.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>In water that reaches up to the body of the vehicle it is 
  significantly better to be pointing downstream.</FONT> </LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Since water has the disturbing tendency to get deeper when 
you least expect it, you might as well cross rivers on a downstream 
tack.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This whole argument is pointless if there is only one exit 
point from the river (due to trees or a steep bank).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When you reach the riverbank and it starts to get steep, you 
need to turn the wheels into the slope so that you climb it straight up, as per 
the instructions under "Steep Climbs".</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Deep_Mud/Snow></A>Deep Mud/Snow</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When faced with deep mud or snow, you might find yourself 
bogging down and making little progress. A rapid swinging of the steering wheel 
(by placing one hand at the 12 o'clock position and swinging it from 'knee to 
knee' it will help you move forwards. This works by giving the front wheels 
purchase on the sides of any ruts you might be in. This only works, of course, 
if your truck has front wheel drive or four wheel drive engaged.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The consensus on the list is that although in theory it 
should also work when reversing, the added stress on the front drive train, and 
the added possibility of the wheels catching hard and shooting you in a 
direction that you don't want to go, make this a 'last resort' method when in 
reverse.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Well, I was just stuck in some nasty frame-deep lake-bottom 
mud, and what I did (and it worked, praise be!) was to crank the steering wheel 
left to right, but all the way to the steering limiters, while the truck was in 
low reverse idling backwards. I would change from left to right whenever it 
stopped moving. Every now and then it would 'hook up' and I would just let it 
move in whatever direction it could get traction in. Obviously there are 
situations where that method isn't a good one; for instance if you are on a 
lakeshore and you know that going towards the lake is just not a good idea, then 
you might try going full turn, back to center, and back to the full turn always 
pointing away from the lake.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Try to make <I>small</I> corrections with the wheel, rather 
than large ones.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>As soon as you get the wheels points more than 5 degrees or 
so off center they will start to just churn and not help in moving forward. The 
front wheels act as rudders in the deep stuff, but if you don't have the power 
to push forward then you're lost. If you start to slip and lose traction, and 
end up coming to a halt, try straightening your wheels and rocking a bit (just 
put it in reverse and use the clutch to alternate between power and neutral 
until you get a good rocking going), then try to scoot backwards enough to get 
some room to accelerate forwards again, and keep the wheels straight.</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=Mud></A>Mud</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mud is everywhere. Some love it, some hate it. Some love to 
get dirty, others hate having to spend $10 at the coin-op to get the black, 
stinking swamp ooze off of their truck. No matter which camp you inhabit, you 
might find yourself hub-deep in the sticky stuff some day, so a few hints might 
come in handy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Unless you have well separated lugs, mud can be impossible 
to deal with.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Regular 'all terrain' tires will just fill with mud and give 
you all the traction of a racing slick. You need a tire that satisfies the M+S 
(Mud and Snow) designation for self-cleaning lugs. Not every M+S tire will 
self-clean in the sticky stuff; it's got to have a good, wide lug spacing (like 
1/2" or more) to clean properly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Mud can be sneaky. Sometimes you're on top of it and don't 
even know it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>There's a story that Mike Taylor related in the first 
newsletter of the True North Toyota Land Cruisers. This story illustrates so 
well several things that you should <I>not</I> do, that I feel that it was 
destined to be added to the FAQ, and I'm sure Mike will agree (once he finds out 
that I used it, that is!). 8-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I had my first good stuck the other day; I went fishing with 
my dad and we were trying different streams in the Jock river area.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>As I was starting to cross a grassy field to get to one 
small creek, the back wheels spun. I got out to look; the grass was wet, but no 
worse than that. As a precaution, I locked the hubs and put the machine in 
4-low. With one touch of the gas, I was sitting frame-deep in gumbo; brown, 
sticky, the worst. There I was, hi- lift at home, no shovel, my Warn 8274 8000lb 
winch sitting' in my garage DOIN' ME NO GOOD AT ALL. My new rod and reel with 
4-pound test wasn't an option. Fortunately, a neighboring farmer towed me out 
with his tractor. [snip]</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Now we get to critique Mike's driving. Easy to do from this 
armchair. 8-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Now, as soon as the wheels slipped, he got out to check out 
the situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Very good. Many people would have just stomped on the gas. 
The driving error was using so low a gear with too much throttle. Mike's truck 
is a diesel 'cruiser with a granny low of about 55:1. If you so much as 
<I>breathe</I> on the gas from a stop in that gear you will dig down fast. Now 
the non driving related error: he had no unstucking gear. So what should Mike 
have done? Well, definitely lock the hubs, and switch to 4WD, but use as high a 
gear as you can start in easily (3rd gear, in Mike's case) and feather in the 
clutch without touching the throttle. Now, Mike didn't have any indication that 
he was on quicksod, but when I suspect that wheel-spin will be tragic and I have 
to start from speed zero, I will use the hill-trick of shutting off the truck, 
putting it in the second lowest gear, and then without touching the gas just 
turn the key to start it. The starter motor will drive you smoothly for 5-10 
feet before the engine starts. Since the starter motor doesn't have all that 
much power you won't spin the wheels.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This only works if your truck doesn't have an interlock that 
keeps you from starting it in gear.</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=Ice></A>Ice</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Ice gives you little or no traction, no matter <I>what</I> 
kind of tires you have. If you're on slick ice, then all you can do is plan 
ahead. Give yourself lots of time to slow down. Stop at the crests of hills to 
check out the situation. Is there a rut that might grab your tires and throw you 
into the trees? Studs will perk your tires up <I>incredibly</I> on ice, but 
they're not legal in all areas. Chains don't have as much of an effect on ice 
unless they're specifically made to grip ice.</FONT></P>

in gear during the stop, and it won't be able to lock the wheels. You'll have to 
use the clutch before the engine stalls, of course, but you can get down to a 
very slow speed before you have to rely on the brakes alone.</FONT></P>
<H3><FONT face=Arial><A name=What_if?__Dealing_with_emergencies></A>What if? 
Dealing with emergencies.</FONT></H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Let me start off by saying that this is <I>not</I> intended 
to be a survival article. There are way too many books on that subject already. 
What I'm going to do is give you some hints on making it easier to be found. In 
other words, rather than instruction on snaring rabbits while waiting to be 
found, I'm going to tell you how to make it easier for the Search And Rescue 
(SAR) boys and girls to find you faster.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Rule #1 is to let someone know where you're going. If you 
get lost or stranded, it really sucks to not know whether anyone is looking or 
not. Having people actively looking for you greatly increases your chance of 
being found. Using your credit card to buy gas is a good thing, as then the 
searchers can find out where you last fueled up, and that might give them a clue 
as to where you are. Best is to phone home every time you fill up.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Rule #2 is to listen to the weather forecast for the area 
you will be traveling in. If there's bad weather coming you might want to 
postpone your trip, or at least take precautions</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Rule #3 is to always have emergency equipment suitable for 
the area you will be traveling in. You don't need bug juice in midwinter in the 
Yukon, but you'd better have your shovel. See the lists of expedition gear 
above.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Rule #4 is to have good navigational gear so you won't 
<I>get</I> lost in the first place. If it's too late to avoid it, keep 
reading.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Lost!></A>Lost!</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Lost is more a state of mind than a state of body. The first 
thing to do (and I mean the FIRST thing) is to sit down. Sit down and mellow 
out. Don't drive. Don't walk. Don't run. Sit <I>down</I>. If you're in the truck 
then shut it off and wait. For half and hour or so. When you realize you're lost 
your brain starts doing back flips and your glands start pumping out enough 
epinephrine to put a yak into a coma, and if you give in to the fear you will 
run... and run... and run... until you are totally exhausted and well and truly 
<I>lost</I>!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>So mellow out until you can think clearly. Sometimes this is 
all it takes. You will suddenly realize where you went wrong and will be able to 
find your way back easily. No matter how certain you are that you know where 
you're going at this point, leave a trail so that you can get back to this 
location. This location is where you realized you were lost, so it must be close 
to where you need to be to be found. If you can stay in this location, you'll 
probably get found faster.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you're hopelessly lost, then you might as well be 
stranded, so follow the advice in that subsection.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Stranded!></A>Stranded!</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The vehicle is inoperable. There is no way it's going to 
take you anywhere. A wheel fell off or something. Now you need to be 
found.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Do you have a cell phone or CB/short-wave transmitter? If 
so, call for help (as long as you have battery power). If not, there are still 
several options.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>First off, calm down. A human being in reasonable physical 
condition can survive for a month with no food, as long as they have water. Do 
you have water? Even if you don't, you can still live for a week or more, though 
you'll be in a bad way by the fifth day or so. Do <I>not</I> drink radiator 
water if it has antifreeze in it! It'll crash your kidneys and leave you in a 
bad way. Unless you want a (brief) lifetime of dialysis, don't do it. If you 
don't have water, then don't eat, as digestion will use up your water reserves. 
From personal experience I know that the second day without food is the worst. 
After that it's not too bad. Just relax and don't think about it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Conserve your energy. Rest. Food in the wilderness is fairly 
low calorie, and won't be keeping you up as well as you think it is. For 
instance, say you were on a fishing trip and you're stranded next to a trout 
stream. You have your fishing tackle and pole, and you are pulling 6 one and a 
half pound trout out of the stream every day. You think you're eating pretty 
good (6 pounds of trout a day, after they're cleaned). In reality, those trout 
are only providing about 250 calories each, so you're only getting about 1500 
calories a <I>day</I>. An active man breaking trail in the woods needs more like 
<A name=calories_to_remain_at__a__normal__energy__level></A>4000 calories to 
remain at a normal energy level. The bottom line is to conserve energy. Catch 
the fish, but don't go jogging. By the way, you don't have to worry about scurvy 
or any kind of vitamin deficiency for a loooong time, so don't bother getting 
yourself in a pucker about them. If you're in the bush that long, scurvy will be 
the least of your worries.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In cases where people 'disappear' in their vehicles the 
vehicle itself is usually found in just a few days after the search 
begins.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>What this means is that you want to stay with the vehicle. 
As long as someone knew more or less where you were going, and when you expected 
to be back, you shouldn't have to wait more than a week before you're found. The 
vehicle is not a perfect shelter, but it will cut the wind. In extreme heat (30C 
plus) don't stay in the truck, but rather <I>under</I> it. That way you will get 
shade, and you won't be in the oven that is your truck. If you have blankets 
then you can make a lean-to tent against your vehicle to provide shade. Don't 
exert yourself in the heat. Try not to sweat, you will waste water. Move slow. 
Don't talk. Suck on a pebble to keep from mouth-breathing. In extreme cold 
(colder than about -20C) the vehicle won't help you any insulation-wise, but it 
will keep the wind off of you, and if you lie on the bench seat (if you have a 
bench seat) and pile your blankets on top of you (loose, not tight) then you 
will be warm enough to live, as long as you have food to keep the furnace 
stoked. If you know how to build a snow shelter, then I'll leave it up to your 
discretion whether to use one or not. Don't sweat. Don't get wet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you have to leave the vehicle (it's in an avalanche area, 
or you're just going to try to scare up some cattail rhizomes to eat) leave a 
note. If you don't have paper, then you can write it in dirt sprinkled on the 
seat, or some other method can be employed. Make sure the wind won't blow your 
note away. And blaze a trail. Just break the tops of bushes as you go so that 
they point back towards camp. Using this technique you shouldn't be able to lose 
track of the vehicle, and if searchers find one of your blazes they'll be able 
to find your camp.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the interest of being seen from the air you should have 
the vehicle as conspicuous as possible. Parked in the middle of an open area, 
for instance. If the top of the vehicle is dark then a light-colored tarp will 
help it remain visible (unless you're on snow, of course, in which case you want 
the top dark, and keep clearing the snow off of it).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The international distress signal is a group of three. Three 
blasts on the horn, three gunshots, three columns of smoke, whatever. In a 
wooded area you just build up a punky fire with rotten wood and green vegetation 
(or forest loam, or engine oil) and wait. You can burn a tire, and it will smoke 
a lot, but it burns <I>really</I> hot, so don't just toss your spare on the 
coals next to your lean-to; give it some room. It's a good idea to have a fire 
set up under a tarp or other rain-proof covering that you don't use unless you 
see a plane, then you can quickly build a fire that the pilot can see, and he 
won't be gone by the time it's going. Mirrors are excellent signals in the 
daytime. A mirror can reflect light for a staggering distance. You have several 
mirrors on your truck, so make use of them, even if you have to tear them off to 
use them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the usual 'backwoods' places of today (not including the 
deep interiors of the far north of Canada and Alaska, and the Australian 
outback) if you build a smoky fire by day, and a bright fire by night, you're 
pretty much guaranteed to be found within a week.</FONT></P>

<H4><FONT face=Arial><A 
name="What's_the_big_deal_about_a_Hi-Lift_jack?"></A>What's the big deal about a 
Hi-Lift jack?</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>A Hi-Lift jack (HLJ) or equivalent (Jack-all, etc.) does far 
more than just lift a corner of your truck to change a tire. An HLJ can be used 
(tediously) as a winch, but it's main feature is its ability to pivot an end of 
the vehicle from point to point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>If you jack up the front end of a vehicle from the center of 
the bumper so that both front wheels are off the ground, you can push that end 
of the car over to one side, thereby moving the front wheels a couple of feet to 
one side, and effectively turning the vehicle 20 degrees or so. Can be very 
handy because it's faster to pivot the front or rear wheels out of a deep hole 
than it is to winch it using the HLJ.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The situation where pivoting with the HLJ becomes really 
crucial is when you get yourself in over your head on a boulder problem. It's 
happened to everyone. You see a line that looks doable. You start moving in. You 
miscalculated. All of a sudden your rig is belly down on a rock, and all the 
fancy driving in the world isn't going to get your truck out of there. You just 
want to be home. In bed. With the covers over your head.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Using a winch in this situation will just cause major 
scrape-damage to the underbelly and potentially rip brake lines, fuel lines, 
etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The thing to do is to use your handy-dandy HLJ to lift the 
front (or back, depending on your lie) off of the obstruction and slowly inch it 
over. You have two choices: either crank it real high and push it over, hoping 
that it won't land on anything tender, or you can crank it up, push it over a 
foot or two (but not so much that it overbalances and falls) and lower it slowly 
onto the rock again, repeating until you're far enough over that you know for 
sure that you can pivot it fully without maiming your truck.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>It's irritating. It's tedious. It's the only game in town, 
unless you have a friend with a cargo helicopter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Using the same general technique you can lift a wheel back 
onto a rock that it slipped off of to re-establish your line.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Additionally, a Hi-Lift brand jack can have a top jaw added 
that makes it look like a giant woodworker's bar clamp. It will inflict many 
tons of crushing pressure; just the thing for straightening bent frames and 
suspension parts (if you can get <I>in</I> there.. the irritating thing is that 
you can't do this with the vehicle jacked up, obviously.. unless you have two 
jacks).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Some people claim success with moving a vehicle forwards or 
backwards with a HLJ using the pivot method. I advise strongly against this, as 
the potential for damage (due to the jack beam hitting something) is just too 
great.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Be careful using the pivot method to move your truck around 
by the back bumper if you have bumperettes. If you don't have a free arc to 
swing the jack beam in, the method won't work. Jacking from the bumperettes 
<I>can</I> be done, and I <I>have</I> had to do it, but it worried me, and one 
of them bent. If you have the option, don't use the bumperette as a jacking 
point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Keep your Hi-Lift oiled. I have been warned that they can 
get 'sticky' and not work properly (it sucks to get your truck jacked up only to 
find out you can't get it back down again). I had this happen to me in the Great 
Lake Extraction of '96, and it was annoying. When the jack doesn't operate 
smoothly it's just another thing to worry about when you really need to focus on 
other things.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A 
name="Do_I_really_need_a_tow_rope_if_I'm_driving_alone?"></A>Do I really need a 
tow rope if I'm driving alone?</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>It's a good idea. You might need it to keep your truck from 
sliding down a cliff if you drop a wheel off, and you'll need one to use your 
Hi-Lift jack as a winch, or if your regular winch cable isn't long enough to 
reach a good anchor. There is also the ever-popular 'sloped trail washout 
crossing' which requires a tow rope or two. It's a good idea to use a safety 
rope when crossing unknown rivers that might get deep in the middle.</FONT> 
<P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=What_kind_of_fire_extinguisher_do_I_need?></A>What 
kind of fire extinguisher do I need?</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Automotive fire extinguisher chemicals vary in composition. 
Normally, extinguishers have three different chemicals referred to by the 
letters 'A', 'B' and 'C' for ordinary fires (wood, and other 'dry' things 
burning), flammable liquid fires, and electrical fires respectively. Now, the 
right extinguisher for any given situation depends on <I>what</I> is burning. In 
a car, a fire is usually started by an electrical problem ('C') but if you do 
end up with oil or gasoline burning ('B') then that's something that needs to be 
dealt with VERY quickly. If, however, the seats or carpet is burning, you need 
'A'. It isn't practical to have three different extinguishers, so the 
manufacturers use custom chemicals that effect various ratios for different 
purposes. The most common automotive ratio seems to be a <A 
name=mix,___or__thereabouts></A>1A/5BC mix, or thereabouts. That means that six 
pounds of the chemical used in the extinguisher will extinguish as much burning 
material as 1 pound of a dedicated 'A' chemical, and 2.5 pounds each of 
dedicated 'B' and 'C' chemicals. Gives you a 'broad spectrum' approach. You can 
buy either disposable extinguishers, or refillable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Disposables are inexpensive, and in a situation where you 
may well never use your extinguisher, it's a satisfactory selection as long as 
the disposable unit holds at least a pound of chemical. Two pounds is better. 
The drawback to the disposable units is that over time all extinguishers lose 
pressure, and you can't just 'top up' a disposable unit. You have to buy a new 
one. Keep in mind that disposables generally are filled with a dry chemical, so 
when you use it you will end up with a car full of white crud everywhere. Better 
than losing the car, but gas extinguishers (such as Halon) don't have this 
problem. Halon, however, acts like CFCs in their attack of the ozone layer. So 
if you might never use it, why have it? Just in case you're one of those unlucky 
souls who <I>does</I> need it. My cousin's car just burned down around him about 
a month ago. He didn't have an extinguisher. This wasn't an ancient clunker, it 
was a decent, certified car. It went up so fast he couldn't do anything to save 
it. I gave him an earful for not having an extinguisher, because he should know 
better. He's a professional firefighter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Here's more vehicular fire-fighting hints from Chris 
Siano:</FONT> 
<OL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>When putting out an engine fire, <EM>do not</EM> open the 
  hood. Spray through the radiator, or from a wheelwell, or (if possible) from 
  below the front bumper. Opening the hood simply allows air to flow and the 
  fire may flare up directly into your face.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Hot batteries can explode. There is no way to tell if a 
  battery is shorted or damaged without raising the hood, and you don't want to 
  do that (see (1) above). While fighting the fire, avoid the general area 
  around the battery. Do not face into the radiator, and otherwise try to keep 
  your face away as you spray into other areas. You may not be as effective in 
  stopping the fire, but it is better than getting a face full of hot battery 
  acid. Even when the fire is out, be very cautious of the battery. A warm 
  battery releases hydrogen gas, the slightest spark can cause trouble. This is 
  especially important if you need to disconnect the battery for any reason. A 
  battery switch can be a wise investment.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Modern Catalytic converters can easily reach 600 or more 
  degrees Fahrenheit. Parking, stopping, and even driving over high grass can 
  ignite it. Be very cautious.</FONT> </LI></OL>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This same phenomenon (grass-induced spontaneous combustion) 
was mentioned to me by Henry Cubillan. It's a wise move to check for dry grass 
stuffed around the engine block every half hour or so when driving in deep 
grass.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Which_Winch_is_Winchiest?></A>Which Winch is 
Winchiest?</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>This is another religious debate. The question is not one of 
size (astonishingly enough) as the established requirement is 1.5 times the 
gross weight of the vehicle. So my BJ42 with its slightly over 5000 pound GVW 
would need a bit over 7500 pounds, so I'd go with an 8000 pound winch (unless, 
of course, I saw a good deal on a 9000 or 10000).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Many people feel that bigger <I>is</I> better, though. A 
10000 pound winch will generally use less energy pulling 7000 pounds than a 7000 
pound winch will.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The question, though, is which <I>kind</I> of winch? 
Electric or hydraulic? PTO? Planetary gears or worm gears?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In general, you want a winch that's strong enough to pull 
your truck out of the mud, and you want one with the options that you feel are 
worth the money.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Some common options are:</FONT> 
<OL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Remote (wired, or wireless) so you can stand out of the 
  path of any broken cable etc. and you can get a better view of what's going 
  on.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Freewheeling. This is the ability of the winch to be put 
  into 'neutral' so you can pull out the cable you need and don't have to wait 
  for the winch to slowly unspool it.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Roller fairlead. By default many winches come with a 
  hawse fairlead, which is just a slot cut in a sheet of metal. A roller 
  fairlead has steel rollers that don't cause the cable as much grief, so the 
  cable lasts longer and doesn't get as hand-maimingly frayed.</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial>Gears? Worm gears are slow, but they have the benefit of 
  having reliable built-in braking; there is no worry of the winch giving way 
  and letting cable unspool under load. Planetary gears are faster, but they 
  don't have the inherent braking properties. Auxiliary brakes are installed in 
  these winches to overcome this lack. All in all, planetary gears look like the 
  choice of champions.</FONT> </LI></OL>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=PTO_Winches></A>PTO Winches</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The ultimate grunt winch. Nothing will out-pull a PTO 
winch.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>They're tough, they're reliable, and they'll pull a barn off 
of its foundations. A PTO winch can run faster than an electric or hydraulic 
(over a foot per second), because you can put the truck into whatever gear you 
want. A PTO winch can run all day without a problem (as long as you have enough 
gas in your truck 8-)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The bad part is that they're heavy, they're dear as diamonds 
from the dealer, and they only work if the engine is running. If you stall and 
can't get the vehicle re-started, you're out of luck. PTO winches also tend to 
be somewhat spartan; no remote, no other 'goodies'. Many don't freewheel (unless 
there's a dog-clutch on the winch itself, which means getting out of the cab and 
walking over to the winch). In theory, you can run a PTO winch off of the 
starter motor if the truck stalls. Might be worth a try.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Before plunking down good money for that aged PTO winch at 
the wreckers, made darn sure that you can get parts for it. According to my 
Toyota dealer, there are <I>no</I> spare parts available for their PTO winches. 
Make sure you can get them for the winch that you want to buy.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Electric_Winches></A>Electric Winches</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The most common solution. These run off of your battery, so 
you need to have a pretty serious battery if you want to have full power from 
your winch (good sized winches have a draw of around 400 amps).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>You operate these winches with the engine running, otherwise 
you'll just drain the battery that much faster, and you might not be able to get 
the truck started again. Even with the engine idling you can't run them for 
long, as alternators generally supply between 50 and 100 amps (though 
alternators of up to 250 amps are available for some trucks for welding 
applications, etc). These are the heaviest winches, so you might need to upgrade 
your front shock absorbers to compensate. Make sure that the solenoids are 
protected from moisture; if they get wet your winch won't work until they dry. 
If the solenoids stay dry (they can be installed remotely in the cab) then an 
electric winch will work under water.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>An electric winch with a permanent magnet motor has much 
less of an appetite for power than a series-wound motor, but has the drawback of 
overheating easily. If you plan on being the 'winch guy' in the group and 
pulling everybody else up, you had better get a series-wound motor.</FONT></P>
<H4><FONT face=Arial><A name=Hydraulic_Winches></A>Hydraulic Winches</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Possibly the best solution for most of us. There are two 
general types available; the variety that runs from the hydraulic pressure in 
the power- steering pump, and the type that runs from a separate, dedicated 
pump. The former is cheaper, the latter is better.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Hydraulic winches are strong and light, and are sort of a 
middle-ground between electric and PTO winches. You can get hydraulic winches 
with remotes, though many of them can only freewheel when you turn the handle on 
the winch itself. They run cool, and most have a 100% duty cycle. Decent hydro 
winches have a great appetite for power. Running a hydro pump hard enough and 
fast enough to power a winch pulling in 8000 pounds at 36 feet per minute (way 
faster than electric winches) takes about 20 horsepower. You can't run this 
serious a pump off of the crank with a belt. The belt will slip. You can try 
using a double belt, but generally the hydraulics are set up with the pump being 
powered directly from the crank (via a direct coupling) or via the PTO drivegear 
on the idler shaft of the transfer case (if you have a PTO drivegear). Hydraulic 
cost a lot to set up, but I think they're worth it.</FONT></P>
