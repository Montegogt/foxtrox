                        revision to their Mud-Terrain T/A that has been a very 
                        popular tire ever since it was introduced in 1980. 
                        Cosmetically speaking, the changes made to the tire are 
                        subtle, but the tire remains true to its own 
                        heritage.</FONT></P>

                        size=2>According to BFGoodrich's Jeff Cummings, several 
                        years and many different tread patterns, including 
                        extreme ones, went into the development of the new M/T. 
                        However, they kept coming back to the tried-and-true 
                        original design and used it as the basis for the new KM 
                        model. Will the updated design be a vast improvement? 
                        Time will tell.</FONT></P>

                        traditional dog bone lug design, with the addition of 
                        aggressive shoulder lugs, stylishly called 
                        "<I>DiggerLugz</I>". The redesign also includes a rim

                        against the jagged rocks. More than anything, I was 
                        expecting to cut a sidewall or lose a bead, but

                        the time of this photo shoot, I had had the tires 
                        installed for nearly 4,000 miles. Within that time, I 
                        had used them for two trail runs, one of which, was dirt 
                        terrain with some mud and the other was mostly loose,

                        most similarly classed tires, I've found the BFGoodrich

                        contours to the terrain, but it really retains its shape 
                        very well when it is under a lot of stress. You can see

                        don't feel there is a noticeable difference on-pavement

                        and overall thickness per manufacturer, so comparing 2

                        Tellico is a popular four-wheeling spot on the east

                        They were very quiet and very comfortable for myself and

                        central Pennsylvania, ran many of the popular Tellico

                        their surefootedness, and they held my Jeep true to its 
                        path. This allowed me to successful straddle the hole
