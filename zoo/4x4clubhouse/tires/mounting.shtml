      <P><FONT size=+1>Tire out-of-balance is usually in the tread area (A), see 
      illustration, since the tread is the heaviest part of the tire and the 
      part farthest away from the center of the axle. In the illustration, (A) 
      represents the heavy spot; in the example let's say it is 5 ounces. (B) is 
      the area of the rim where weights are usually applied. (C) is the center 
      of the axle, (D) is the diameter of the rim, (E) is the diameter of the 
      tire and here we are using a 34 inch diameter tire for the example. Area 
      (A) is 17 inches away from the center of the axle (a 34 inch diameter tire 
      divided by 2 equals 17 inches) and area (B) is 7-1/2 inches away from the 
      center of the axle (a 15 inch rim divided by 2 equals 7-1/2 
      inches).</FONT></P></TD>

      <P><FONT size=+1>In this illustration the 5 ounces of imbalance is far out 
      from the center of the axle (17 inches) and an attempt to balance the 
      assembly will require putting weights on the edge of the rim which is much 
      closer to the center of the axle (7-1/2 inches). To balance the tire in 
      this example by placing weights at point (B) to correct the 5 ounces of 
      out-of-balance at point (A) will require considerably more than five 
      ounces of weight to bring the tire into balance. These figures will change 
      depending on the number of ounces of weight a tire is out of balance and 
      the diameter of the tire in relation to the diameter of the rim it is 
      mounted on. In this particular example the amount of weight required to 
      bring this 5-ounce out of balance into balance with the tire mounted on a 
      15 inch diameter rim would be 10.6 ounces. The 'taller' a tire is and the 
      'shorter' the rim is the more weight it takes to bring the assembly into 
      balance. Even more weight is required when using the stick-on type of 
      weights applied to the drop center part of the wheel because the weight is 
      being applied even closer to the axle. This is sort of like a 200 pound 
      kid trying to seesaw with a 100 pound kid...it just does not work unless 
      the heavier kid moves closer to the center of the board.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>The best way to overcome this situation is if you were to 
      determine the heavy spot of the tire (in the illustration it is 5 ounces) 
      before it was mounted and place a 5 ounce internal 'balance patch' or 
      'dough compound' directly opposite the 5 ounce heavy spot by gluing the 
      'balance patch' to the inside of the tire which would be placing the 
      'balance patch' (weight) very close to the 17 inch radius from the center 
      axle point it would require only about 5 ounces of 'balance patch' to 
      properly balance the tire. After this would be done and the tire mounted 
      on the wheel the entire tire and wheel assembly could be put on a 
      balancing machine to correct for any imbalance in the wheel itself or some 
      minor dynamic imbalance that may be present. None of these procedures will 
      give satisfactory results if the rim is warped or has too much run-out to 
      begin with.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>We hope this information helps you in understanding some 
      of the factors involved in proper balancing and that a tire is never 'out 
      of balance' as much as the number of ounces of weight required to 
      'balance' it using conventional balancing equipment.</FONT></P></TD>
