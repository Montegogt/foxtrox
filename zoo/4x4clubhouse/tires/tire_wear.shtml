      Tire Mileage </FONT></I></B></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>There is always a trade off between performance and tread 
      life in the development of tires. To gain one thing you have to trade off 
      something else. Some brag when they get 15000 miles out of a set of tires 
      because they understand how hard they drive while others complain if they 
      get 40 to 50000 miles. The next paragraph explains many things someone can 
      do to improve mileage regardless of how they drive, the type of tire, or 
      the power of their truck.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>Tread life is related to many factors some of which are; 
      the air pressure maintained, how often air pressure is checked, rotation, 
      driving habits, road surfaces, road conditions, suspension setup, caster 
      and tow alignment, shock absorbers, etc. There is a relationship between 
      the size tire used and the weight of the truck.. .the larger the tire and 
      the lighter the truck the better the mileage tends to be and the smaller 
      the tire and the heavier the truck the less the tread life will be. One of 
      the worst mistakes made is neglect of air pressure. Air pressure should be 
      checked at least once a month with an accurate gauge and checked when the 
      tires are cool. Two things support the weight of a vehicle...the actual 
      air pressure and the volume of air in a tire. When a big tire is used the 
      larger volume of air will support the vehicle with very little air 
      pressure but that does not mean the tire is stable. The tire will look 
      like it is under inflated because it does not appear to be low but this 
      low air pressure makes the tire unstable which causes squirming of the 
      tread. It is OK to run tires low off road but the pressure should be 
      bought back up as soon as you put the vehicle back on the highway. It is 
      recommended that tires used on four wheel drive vehicles be rotated front 
      to rear and rear to front about every four to five thousand miles...don't 
      criss-cross.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>As you can see from the above there is no way of knowing 
      what tread life a given set of tires will have. The compounds used in the 
      tread rubber also vary but is constant with each type of tire 
      manufactured. Manufacturers try to achieve a balance in tread compounds 
      that will provide good highway traction and overall performance while not 
      sacrificing too much in tread life.</FONT></P>

      size=+1></FONT></B><FONT color=#ffff00 size=+1>.</FONT><FONT size=+1> 
      Tires provide traction because the weight of the vehicle forces the tread 
      rubber into the road's small surface irregularities. Unfortunately, that 
      same interaction causes wear as the surface tears microscopic pieces of 
      rubber from the tread as it slips into and out of contact with the road. 
      And just as coarser sandpaper removes material faster, coarser road 
      textures cause more tire wear. The following mileage estimate is typical 
      of what a 40000 mile rated tire driven on smother asphalt would deliver if 
      driven exclusively on other road surfaces.</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      size=+1></FONT></B><FONT size=+1> Wheel alignment controls the 
      distribution of vehicle load across the tire's footprint. Camber is the 
      tire's tilt inward (negative) or outward (positive) when viewed from the 
      front and has significant impact on handling and shoulder wear. Caster is 
      the angle of steering axis tilt when viewed from the side and while it 
      does not affect wear, it does affect the vehicle's handling and tendency 
      to track straight down the road. Toe is the direction that the tires are 
      aimed when viewed from above. Toe-in is when the tires are pointed towards 
      each other; toe-out is when the tires are pointed away from each other. 
      Toe greatly affects tire wear since a setting just 1/16 of an inch off 
      will make the tires want to travel sideways about 150 feet every 
      mile.</FONT></P>
