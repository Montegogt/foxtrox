      <P>Interco Tire Corporation has been busy over the winter developing a new 
      tire. The new 37x13 Super Swamper TSL/Bogger is the answer to many 
      consumer requests. Granted, the Bogger is not new to the wheeling 
      industry, this size proves Interco can be competitive in a tough market. 
      The 37" tire is a popular size these days for most Rockcrawlers. With the 
      advent of Rockcrawling Championships making a breakthrough in the past 
      years, tires are being tested to their limits, and Interco has again stood 
      up to the plate and hit a home run. Super Swamper TSL/Boggers have been 
      used on many competition vehicles and have won competitions such as the 
      Top Truck Challenge, Rockcrawling Championships, and many Mud racing 
      competitions.</P>

      <P>"First Impressions are always Important"</P></B>
      <P>I called Interco and ordered a set of the New 37"x13" Super Swamper 
      TSL/Boggers for 15" diameter rim. After receiving the tires, my first 
      impression was great. The width of this tire is proportional to its height 
      giving the tire a very rugged look. The tread is not overly wide and the 
      height is quite adequate for getting you through those deeply rutted 
      trials, even when pressures are lowered. Tread is the standard Three-Stage 
      Lug design, which will aid in finding traction when it’s needed. The new 
      TSL/Boggers will definitely win the best-looking tire category and will 
      have people gazing at your Truck as you drive by. As a bonus, the tire is 
      not only good looking; it is also very functional. I started my overview 
      by carefully measuring the tires and recording their size after 
      installation on my 15x10 rims. Here’s what I found.</P><FONT

      <P>Specifications</P></B>
      <P>At 28 psi, the 37" TSL/Boggers are at 96% of their total dimensional 
      size, which is advertised by Interco. The TSL/Bogger is a bias tire, which 
      generally gives very good off-road performance but diminishes street 
      performance. I chose this air pressure to give good street performance 
      during our ventures to and from trails. See the table below for 
      dimensional data.</P></FONT>

      <P>* </B>Measurements taken with tires on vehicle at pressures 
      specified.</P><B>
      <P>Its all about Pressure</P></B>
      <P>I have been experimenting with tire pressures in various terrains. I 
      have made many assumptions on the correct tire pressure for a typical 
      terrain, only to be fooled by the true ability of this tire. This tire was 
      designed primarily for mud and soft terrain, but I have found that with 
      the correct tire pressure, there are typically no limits to this tire’s 
      ability to work. A number of times I was able to climb some very difficult 
      rock ledges with loose gravel and dirt coverings, with 25 psi in the 
      tires! I discovered however, your tires will perform better with less 
      pressure in these situations. I aired down to 8 psi and climbed the same 
      rock ledge and found it to be effortless. In fact, I could not believe it 
      made such a difference! Many of the tests ran with these tires, I found 
      that 8-10 psi is my typical tire pressure of choice. The sidewalls on the 
      New 37" Super Swamper TSL/Bogger are 4 ply which resist punctures at low 
      pressures. I found the sidewalls are stiff enough to give you sufficient 
      clearance under your differentials, as well as pliable enough to conform 
      to rocks and terrain. The stiffness of the sidewalls has its advantages. 
      You can climb over stumps, rocks, and soft dirt with little worry about 
      popping the tire off the bead. To test this theory, I pointed my Blazer 
      down hill and turned the wheels full crank with only 8 psi in the tires. I 
      chose a dirt hill for this test so it would offer the best traction to try 
      to pop the tire off the bead. At 8psi, the bead held its grip on the rim 
      without problems. I could have experimented with less pressure, but I feel 
      8 psi is my lowest tire pressure requirement. I suggest experimenting with 
      tire pressures on and off the street for the best performance. On road, I 
      typically run around 28 psi for highway trips and in-town driving. I have 
      driven these tires well over 2500 miles without problems or improper wear. 
      On the street, make sure to check your pressure often. Incorrect tire 
      pressure is one cause of improper wear.</P>

      <P>Mud</P></B>
      <P>Look up the word "Mud" in the dictionary and I am positive you should 
      find a picture of the Super Swamper TSL/Bogger tire. The New 37" 
      TSL/Bogger is the answer to anyone’s prayers if you live in muddy terrain. 
      If you are in the market for a mud tire, look no further. The TSL/Bogger 
      is the best mud tire on the market - bar none. Don’t believe me? Check the 
      magazines, local mud races and Jamborees. These tires are primarily 
      designed for mud and goo. In mud, the tire is self-cleaning with each 
      revolution. Even when the tire is spun slowly, it does not retain mud in 
      the voids between the treads. The new 37" tire size hepled me through even 
      the deepest of ruts. It seems even when you feel you should be stuck, your 
      truck keeps moving with the help of these tires. As stated before, each 
      lug is a cupped design. The cupped design lets go of mud easily on each 
      revolution of the tire, therefore offering much more traction than Brand X 
      tires, which tend to trap mud. I have witnessed this many times, other 
      tires just do not offer the traction I need in mud. Where other tires are 
      requiring major wheelspin, the TSL/Bogger requires very little. I also 
      found the TSL/Bogger has great reverse traction in mud - almost the same 
      as the forward traction. If you are into muddy terrain, the TSL/Bogger is 
      for you. </P>

      <P>Rocks</P></B>
      <P>The 37" Super Swamper TSL/Bogger is not only exceptional in the mud, 
      but it fairs well in the rocks. I have pointed my Blazer up many rock 
      ledges and found the tires do their job of finding traction. I have found 
      that tire pressure is critical when rock crawling with the TSL/Boggers. 
      After I found the correct tire pressure in previous tests, I am confident 
      the tires will find the traction I need even in rock covered with dirt and 
      gravel. The rubber compound is soft enough to adhere to rocks and boulders 
      found in most rock crawling trails. With the tires aired down to 8 psi, I 
      crawled through a quarry with sharp, jagged rocks without any sidewall 
      punctures. The tire conforms to many rock surfaces, finding traction - 
      like having "fingers" to grab the rocks. In some occasions where others 
      required bouncing and wheel spin, the TSL/Bogger did not. They prefer slow 
      crawling. I did manage to spin on some rocks with the tire pressure too 
      high and found it tends to rip pieces of the lugs off the carcass. This is 
      easily solved by taking the proper approach and having the correct tire 
      pressure. I found side traction in rocks worked well in dry climates. If 
      the rocks are covered with slick mud or water, the side traction 
      diminishes. The straight through tread is designed for maximum cleaning; 
      therefore the side traction is somewhat low in wet terrain. These tires 
      are able to hold you firmly on the side of a hill in most cases, just be 
      careful and experiment with tire pressures. I have never had these tires 
      fail me in the rocks. I have seen many blown sidewalls on Brand X tires. 
      Don’t leave yourself stranded on the rocks; get a set of Super Swamper 
      TSL/Boggers.</P>

      <P>Sand</P></B>
      <P>My geological location does not offer much in the way of sand. We have 
      the occasional sand bar near creeks and rivers. The sand is typically wet 
      and offers decent traction to many tires. Typically a tall/narrow tire 
      does not work well in sandy conditions. The TSL/Bogger was able to keep me 
      afloat at all speeds. The tire height and width are very proportionate; 
      therefore the tread is wide enough to maintain a good contact patch when 
      properly aired down. One word of caution, if you ever loose momentum while 
      traversing a steep, sandy hill or in extremely dry sand; the TSL/Boggers 
      tend to go south. The cupped tread design does offer good forward traction 
      in sand as long as you can keep the front tires afloat. The tires tend to 
      throw sand just like a paddle tire. Again, with proper pressure these 
      tires can work well in sand.</P>

      <P>Loose Dirt</P></B>
      <P>TSL/Boggers work really well in loose dirt; they tend to self-clean, 
      helping to keep traction at its maximum. Again, pressure is important in 
      loose dirt. When I keep around 8 psi in the tires, forward momentum is 
      very good. I observed several occasions where other tires required more 
      tire spin, and the TSL/Bogger needed very little. In fact, I was crawling 
      up steep hills with loose dirt and others were spinning vigorously, 
      fighting for traction all the way.</P>

      <P>Street</P></B>
      <P>When I ordered my 37" Super Swamper TSL/Boggers, I expected the worst 
      when It came to driveability. There are many tradeoffs when designing a 
      tire for competition as well as street duty. The TSL/Bogger is D.O.T. 
      approved and is quite road worthy. I was shocked after having the tires 
      mounted and balanced, they drove better than the radials I had previously. 
      The tires do howl noticeably, but not overly loud. The TSL/Boggers are a 
      somewhat heavy tire, which require good brakes for your daily driver. This 
      also requires proper gearing for stop and go driving - sufficient power is 
      needed for leaving that stop light in a hurry. The heaviness of this tire 
      also tends to show when you hit potholes or sharp bumps in the pavement. 
      Don’t let this fool you, I have seen many TSL/Bogger equipped rigs which 
      drive to and from trails even hundreds of miles away. I have driven close 
      to 3,000 miles on my TSL/Boggers without a hint of a problem. I check and 
      maintain the tire pressure regularly for proper wear. I have heard stories 
      of only getting 10,000 highway miles from a set of TSL/Boggers but I 
      hardly find it true. With 3,000 miles on my tires, I haven’t noticed much 
      wear at all. Follow Interco’s recommendations on tire pressures and you 
      should have a tire which lasts long for its physical character. The tire 
      is designed with a fairly soft tread compound to get the maximum traction 
      in off-roading situations. The TSL/Bogger did develop a noticeable flat 
      spot when I would allow the truck to sit for a week or so. This flat spot 
      would immediately diminish after a mile or two. </P><FONT

      <P>Breakage of the Test Vehicle</P></B>
      <P>These tires can make you and break you. I found out on one occasion 
      where the Boggers dig hard enough to break a ring gear in my test vehicle. 
      This happened with little power applied, but when you have a tire that 
      delivers extreme traction, something is bound to give.</P>

      <P>That’s it in a Nutshell</P></B>
      <P>The New Super Swamper TSL/Bogger is a tire that stands true to the 
      Quality of Interco. The 37" tire size shows that Interco can meet the 
      needs of a tough market. Interco never makes any outrageous claims when 
      developing a new tire. They do not need to, because their product gives 
      you many miles of service, regardless of the abuse. I have talked 
      extensively with the Interco staff and I must say, they are very helpful. 
      Interco knows their product very well. I am very pleased with the 
      usefulness of this tire, and I’m confident you will too. So, what are you 
      waiting for? Talk to your local Interco Representative today, and never 
      worry about "going nowhere" again.</P>
