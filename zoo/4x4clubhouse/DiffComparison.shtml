      size=3>What's A Differential?</FONT></B></DIV>
      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>When a vehicle 
      is negotiating a corner, the outside wheel has to travel a grater distance 
      than the inside wheel. Therefore, the outside wheel must turn faster than 
      the inside wheel. The differential is the device within the axle assembly 
      which, in addition to transmitting the power to each axle shaft/wheel, 
      allows one wheel to turn at a different speed than the other.</FONT></DIV>

          <TD width="100%"><FONT face=Arial size=2>A conventional open 
            differential sends equal amounts of torque to both axleshafts (top). 
            If one wheel spins because of lost traction, it is sustaining zero 
            engine torque, so zero engine torque is also going to the wheel with 
            traction. Adding a locking differential—in this case a NoSpin locker 
            (bottom)—mechanically links the two shafts so that power will be 
            delivered to both axles in all 
      circumstances.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>

      size=3>Open Differentials:</FONT></B></DIV>
      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>Use two side 
      gears inside the differential case. Each gear is splined to accept an axle 
      shaft. These side gears are in turn driven by a set of spider gears. The 
      spider gears, also inside the differential case, ride on a shaft which is 
      pinned into the differential case and through which all the power is 
      transmitted. The case is driven by the ring gear which is bolted fast to 
      the case. The conventional differential is fitted as standard equipment on 
      most vehicles.</FONT></DIV>

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>On paved roads 
      this system is very successful, giving predictable handling, even tire 
      wear and requiring very little maintenance. However, in off road 
      situations where traction surfaces vary greatly, this type of differential 
      has a major limitation. When one wheel has greater traction than the 
      other, all the power will be directed to the wheel with the least 
      traction. For example, if one wheel is in the air and the other wheel is 
      still on a hard surface, then all the power will be transferred to the 
      wheel in the air. No power will go to the one on the ground and the 
      vehicle will not move.</FONT></DIV>

      size=3>Limited Slips:</FONT></B></DIV>
      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>(LSD's) come in 
      a variety of designs. Most use friction plates, cones and/or gears to 
      reduce slippage between each of the tires. these units have a dual power 
      path from the differential case to the axle shafts. some power is 
      transmitted through the spider gears to the side gears in the conventional 
      manner. The remainder is transmitted by friction between the differential 
      case and the clutch plates and the side gears. A certain amount of "clutch 
      preload" is built into the unit in a static condition. Then, as load is 
      applied to the differential, the separation forces between the spider 
      gears and the side gears increases this clutch loading. This increase in 
      friction provides for a good positive power flow from the case directly to 
      the side gears. When traction is available to both wheels, the power going 
      to the differential causes the plates to bind tightly together, giving 
      even power to both wheels. However, in a situation where there is little 
      or no traction available to either one wheel or the other, the amount of 
      power that can be transmitted to the other wheel which has traction is 
      dependent on the friction or "preload" in the clutch plates. High levels 
      of "clutch preload" will result in good torque transfer but some 
      chattering of the clutches during cornering may occur. Lower levels of 
      preload results in minimal chatter but reduced levels of torque transfer 
      to the wheel with traction. Because LSD's restrict true differential 
      action, tire wear is accelerated. Changes in vehicle handling may also 
      occur, particularly in short wheelbase vehicles. Wear rates on limited 
      slip differentials are generally higher than on other types due to the 
      reliance on friction to reduce wheel slippage. Also, special lubricants 
      may be required to minimize rough and noisy operation. Despite their 
      limitations, LSD's are popular as original equipment options as well as an 
      aftermarket replace because:</FONT></DIV>

      size=3>Automatic Lockers:</FONT></B></DIV>
      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>transmit power 
      to each wheel through a pair of dog clutches. Differential action, such as 
      when cornering is provided by automatically disengaging the appropriate 
      clutch when one wheel rotates faster than the other. This results in 
      differential action which occurs in ratcheting stages rather than being 
      smooth and progressive. Power received by the differential is 
      automatically directed to the wheel with greater traction. Therefore, if 
      one wheel is lifted off the ground, the other wheel will receive the total 
      power applied to the differential to maintain vehicle mobility. Traction 
      is far superior to conventional and limited slip differentials. While 
      automatic locking differential provide excellent performance off road, 
      vehicle handling, particularly on highway, is sacrificed. Unlocking during 
      cornering can be sudden, resulting in a rapid change of direction, 
      particularly in short wheel based vehicles. During sharp cornering an 
      audible ratcheting sound usually occurs as differential action takes place 
      and a loud banging noise may be heard when the unit locks up 
      again.</FONT></DIV>

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>Tire wear is

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>use a 
      conventional differential in conjunction with a mechanical locking device 
      which can be operated at the driver's discretion. when locked, both axles 
      will then turn at the same speed irrespective of the road surface. When it 
      is unlocked, the differential functions as a conventional differential 
      giving predictable handling, long service life and no increase in tire 
      wear. It can be installed in both the front and rear axles without 
      compromising on-road performance. Although manually lockable differentials 
      are available in tractors and some military style vehicles, the 
      installation in mass produced recreation type vehicles have been 
      restricted by high cost and complexity of installation.</FONT></DIV>

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>The ARB Air 
      Locker has allowed this situation to be reversed. This unique air operated 
      unit incorporates its activating mechanism totally inside the differential 
      center. This avoids the need to have complicated piston arrangements 
      hanging off the axle housing. Locking action is controlled by the drive 
      with a push button switch inside the cab. Installation involves a bolt in 
      replacement of the original equipment differential center, a 12 volt air 
      compressor with reservoir and an in-vehicle mounted switch. Original 
      equipment axles, bearings, etc. are retained. Locking/Unlocking of the 
      unit is extremely rapid approximately 0.1 seconds) and may be achieved at 
      any vehicle speed. No special maintenance is required and servicing of 
      other vehicle components is unaffected. Standard lubricants are used. The 
      ARB Air Locker is the ultimate differential for almost any vehicle 
      providing 100% drive to each wheel, without handling problems, or 
      additional wear problems.</FONT></DIV>

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>As the name 
      implies, limited-slip/posi differentials limit or reduce wheel slippage, 
      but do not eliminate it. By applying friction with clutches or cones to 
      the side gears inside the differential, unwanted wheel slippage is 
      reduced. The degree of reduced wheel slippage is determined by the amount 
      of friction, or "breakaway torque," applied to the side gears. While 
      performance varies from one design to another, as little as 15% to 25% of 
      engine torque will be delivered to the higher traction wheel when new and 
      will decline with use. Although better than open differentials, 
      limited-slip/posi differentials do not provide the maximum traction 
      capabilities of locking differentials.</FONT></DIV>

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>Unlike 
      limited-slip/posi differentials, locking differentials deliver 100% of 
      engine torque to both wheels, even if one has zero traction. Locking 
      differentials, commonly referred to as "lockers," are available in either 
      manual or automatic configurations: Manual lockers operate like open 
      differentials when deactivated. When manually activated, they deliver 
      maximum traction by essentially joining together both wheels. Because 
      manual lockers do not differentiate when activated, care must be used to 
      insure they are manually disengaged when making turns on hard surfaces to 
      avoid potential damage.</FONT></DIV>

      <DIV align=left><FONT class=TimesRoman16 face=Arial size=2>Automatic 
      lockers deliver maximum traction without requiring manual activation and 
      deactivation. The wheels are mechanically "locked" together when the 
      vehicle is traveling straight ahead. As the vehicle begins to turn, it 
      automatically; unlocks to allow required wheel differentiation throughout 
      the turn, and then automatically re-locks. Although not as smooth and as 
      quiet as limited-slip/posi differentials, vehicles equipped with automatic 
      locking differentials provide differentiation and the highest level of 
      traction output.</FONT></DIV>
