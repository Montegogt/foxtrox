      Installation Instructions #2</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><FONT color=#000000>T</FONT>his set of 
      instructions are intended to provide you with an overview of the 
      procedures necessary to complete your installation. LockRight installation 
      simply involves disassembling and re-assembling the existing differential 
      case, replacing a few parts in the process. These instructions are 
      detailed to the point that a person who is reasonably familiar with 
      automotive work can install a LockRight into a C-Clip integral carrier 
      axle (and into certain non-C-Clip variants) in about one hour, and into 
      other integral carrier axles in about 2 1/2 hours. We do not recommend 
      shortcuts unless you know exactly what you are doing. These instructions 
      also assume that you have the proper shop manual for reference to 
      instructions about axle shaft removal, torque values, settings, 
      clearances, etc. that apply to your particular vehicle. Our manual is a 
      general guide to operations but does not contain specific information for 
      each vehicle.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><BR><B>Remember: </B>This instruction manual is 
      provided for you convenience to assist you or your mechanic with the 
      installation. When your installation is complete, you will have a vehicle 
      with significantly increased capabilities . For your continued "fun in the 
      sun," operate it in a safe and responsible manner.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Background Information</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The differential case is the round housing 
      inside the rear axle assembly to which the ring gear is bolted and which 
      contains the differential spider and side gear assembly. It is installed 
      in the differential carrier, which is the housing that holds the case, 
      drive pinion gear, bearings, etc. The carrier may be removable (as part of 
      a "drop-out" unit, or third member), or it may be integral (as a permanent 
      part of the axle assembly, mounted in the vehicle). This manual covers the 
      integral carrier design, both C-Clip and non-C-Clip versions,</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The LockRight is designed to fit into standard 
      open differential cases only, not into limited-slip (clutch-pack) type 
      cases. If your vehicle contains a limited-slip unit you will need to 
      purchase a standard open differential case, thrust washers and pinion 
      shaft before proceeding.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>A word about axle shaft thrust blocks:</B> A 
      few differentials, such as the Jeep AMC and the older 19-tooth Spicer 44 
      axle, use a thrust block between the inside ends of the axle shafts as a 
      part of the end play adjustment. When installing a LockRight, this block 
      is reused along with the original axles so that the original end play 
      adjustment does not change. However, if the original axles are changed to 
      different original-type axles, the block will continue to be used but the 
      end play must be re-adjusted (see the shop manual for the procedure). If 
      the axle is changed to another type that does not need end-play 
      adjustment, such as a one-piece design, the thrust block may be omitted. 
      In the Land Cruiser, the block is never used.)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>A word about side gear thrust washers:</B> 
      All differentials originally had a thrust washer under each side gear. 
      Thrust washers are large in diameter and between about 1/32-inch (.031, or 
      0,76 mm) and 1/16-inch (.062, or 1,52-mm) thick. If either one or both are 
      missing from the original differential, obtain new one(s) before 
      proceeding! The LockRight is designed to be used with a correct thrust 
      washer under each coupler, and failure to use this washer is easy to 
      observe during inspection and will void the warranty.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>A word about C-Clips: </B>Many integral 
      carrier differentials have the axle shafts retained by C-Clips. These are 
      semi-circular pieces of hardened steel, similar to a washer with one side 
      cut out, that fit into a groove in the end of the axle shaft and into a 
      pocket in the side gear. The axle shaft is held in place by the pinion 
      (spider gear) shaft. The Lockright is designed for many of these axles, 
      and their installation is covered in this set of instructions. This type 
      of axle is the easiest in which to install a LockRight, typically 
      requiring only about one hour for the procedure.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Note:</B> The parts shown in the following 
      figures are typical and may not exactly depict your particular 
      model.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>LockRight installations covered in this 
      instruction set include the following: Integral carrier axles. Typical of 
      these is Spicer, Jeep AMC 20, GM 10-, 12-, and 14 bolt, Ford 7.5-inch and 
      8.8-inch, Toyota Land Cruiser; similar axles, with and without 
      c-clips.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Preliminary Steps</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The following steps are only a general guide to 
      preliminary operations used for preparing your vehicle for LockRight 
      installation. For detailed information, refer to your shop manual. In 
      general, preliminary steps include:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a) Blocking the vehicle, putting the 
      transmission in neutral;</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b) Loosening the wheel lug nuts (optional with 
      C-Clips and some other axles);</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c) Jacking up the axle, securely resting it on 
      jack stands</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>d) Removing the tires</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>e) Disconnecting the brake lines and emergency 
      brake cables</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>f) Pulling out one or both axles a few 
      inches.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Determination of Axle Type</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Drain the differential oil and remove the 
      cover</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Inspect to determine axle assembly type. If 
      it is a C-Clip design, proceed directly to Section 2. If not, continue 
      with step 3. (next)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Determine if the ring gear is thin enough to 
      be able to pull the pinion (spider gear) shaft out past the teeth. If so, 
      preceed directly to Section 2. If not, continue with Section 1 
      (next).</FONT></P>
      <P align=center><B><FONT color=#9999ff face=Arial size=4>Section 1. 
      Removal of the differential Case and Ring Gear Assembly from the Vehicle 
      (thick ring gear)</FONT></B></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Summary of steps in this 
      section:</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1) Securely block and jack up 
vehicle</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2) Pull out axle shafts by about six 
      inches</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3) Mark carrier and bearing caps</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4) Observe ring gear backlash amount</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5) Remove bearing caps</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6) Remove differential case from 
      carrier</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7) Remove and mark bearing races</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8) Remove ring gear</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9) Install LockRight</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Perform the operations listed below and as 
      described in your shop manual that apply to your vehicle. The axle shafts 
      should be pulled out about six inches for differential case 
      removal.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Using a center punch, mark both the carrier 
      and bearing cap on the ring gear side with one punch mark each and on the 
      other side with two marks. The caps are not interchangeable, because each 
      one is line-bored with the carrier. These marks are very important to 
      correct re-assembly!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Rock the ring gear back and forth to get a 
      "feel" for the amount of backlash present. This amount of rotation will be 
      re-checked when the differential case is installed to determine if it has 
      been done correctly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Remove the bearing caps and then the 
      differential case and shims from the carrier as describe in the shop 
      manual (some axle designs may require the use of a carrier spreader tool). 
      Be sure to put a small grind mark on each shim or tag them so that they 
      can be replaced on the same side.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Remove the differential bearing race from 
      the side with one punch mark first. Put a very small grind mark on the 
      outside of it, or use a tag. Be sure that you can identify it for proper 
      re-assembly on the same side.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Remove the other bearing race.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Remove the ring gear from the case. It may 
      need to be tapped off with a brass mallet (see the shop manual). Mark it 
      so that it can be re-installed in the same rotational orientation as when 
      removed.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Proceed to Section 2 (next) for LockRight 
      installation.</FONT></P>
      <P align=center><B><FONT color=#9999ff face=Arial size=4>Section 2: 
      Disassembly of the Differential Case with thin ring gear, and C-Clips (in 
      the vehicle); also with thick ring gear (case removed from 
      vehicle)</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Note:</B> If the axle assembly is a C-Clip 
      design or has a thin ring gear, the differential case remains in the 
      vehicle and the ring gear side axle shaft does not need to be disturbed 
      ---it simply remains bolted in place and the LockRight installation is 
      done by only partially removing the opposite axle shaft.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Removing the pinion shaft retaining pin, 
      usina a long punch. In the vehicle, the left bearing cap may need to be 
      removed; for C-Clip differentials only, unscrew the bolt.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Remove the pinion shaft.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. For C-Clip differentials only: The C-Clips 
      are located in a grove in the end of each axle shaft and are held in a 
      pocket in the side gear by the pinion shaft. "Bump" each tire inward 
      slightly to free the clips; they will fall out to free up the internal 
      parts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. For installations with the differential case 
      in the vehicle, leave the ring gear side axle bolted in place; pull out 
      only the other axle shaft about two inches.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Remove the spider gears, side gears, all 
      washers, and axle shaft thrust block (if used in your 
assembly).</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Inspection of the Parts</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2><B>Note:</B> These steps are important. The 
      LockRight utilizes your differential case, side gear thrust washers and 
      pinion shaft (plus the axle shaft thrust block, if used), and they must be 
      in excellent condition. The spider gears and washers are not used. If the 
      following inspection shows that anything is bad, buy new parts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Thoroughly clean the differential case and 
      wash remaining parts with solvent, then dry them.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Inspect the pinion shaft. Any noticeable 
      grooves or galling may weaken it and can also adversely affect the 
      operation of your new LockRight. If it is not in excellent condition, 
      obtain a new one.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Inspect the side gear thrust washers. They 
      are important to the correct positioning of the LockRight parts. If they 
      are excessively worn or are cracked, obtain new ones. If several 
      thicknesses are offered, try to obtain the same size as the old ones. 
      Note: There should be TWO thrust washers of about equal thickness, one 
      under each side gear.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Inspect the thrust block (if used). Be sure 
      that the ends are smooth and not galled.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Inspect the case for any chips, cracks or 
      similar damage. Also inspect the bearings, if the case is out of the 
      vehicle. If the case or bearings look bad, replace them. However, if you 
      do, remember that the shims no longer will be correct; the ring and pinion 
      backlash and bearing pre-load will need to be reset with a dial indicator 
      as described in the shop manual.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Preparing the Parts for 
      Assembly</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Coat the teeth of the couplers and drivers, 
      the large center holes of the drivers, and both sides of the thrust 
      washers with medium grease. Also place a little grease in each of the two 
      window holes in each driver. The grease will help hold things in place and 
      assist with functioning until the gear oil circulates.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5) Install other driver (non C-Clip); 
      or</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6) Install other C-Clip (C-Clips 
      only)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Install a coupler and washer assembly in the 
      ring gear end of the differential case (over the axle splines if in the 
      vehicle). See figure 3. Note that the couplers in some models may have 
      flats for clearance. If an axle shaft thrust block is used, place it in 
      the center of the second coupler now if the installation is being done in 
      the vehicle. If not, it may be installed later.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Place the second coupler and washer assembly 
      into the other end of the differential case figure 3.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. For C-Clip differentials only: Place a 
      C-Clip with the ends pointing down into the ring gear side axle shaft end 
      groove and pull the tire out sharply to seat the clip (figure 3). Then, 
      carefully push the other axle into the second coupler splines until the 
      end of the axle shaft is even with the coupler surface. Keep the coupler 
      seated in the case. Note: the ring gear is removed for clarity. 
      Ordinarily, the differential case is in the vehicle and the ring gear is 
      in place.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Important! Be sure to have the spacers

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Pick up one of the driver-and spacer 
      assemblies. Orient its teeth toward the ring gear flange and hold it so 
      that the flats (if present) will clear the sides of the case. Place it on 
      the teeth of the coupler and press it into the grease (figure 4). Reach 
      into the center and push the spacer down onto the coupler shoulder (and 
      over the C-Clip, if so equipped).</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. For non C-Clip axles only, repeat this step

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. For C-Clip axles only, follow the steps 
      below to install the second C-Clip and other driver.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. Make a tool with a piece of stiff wire, such 
      as a coat hanger. Bend it into a "U" shape about four inches wide at the 
      bottom, with one-inch sides.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>b. Place the other driver assembly in the 
      differential case. Push it to the left, touching the other driver (figure 
      5)</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. Using the U-shaped wire between the driver 
      and coupler teeth, push its space leftward into the center of the left 
      driver to help hold it temporarily in place.</FONT></P>

      spring snaps in and is seated all the way. Rotate the drivers and do the 
      same procedure for each of the other three pins and springs.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Reach in through the recesses with your 
      fingers and be sure that the spacers are pushed outward, onto the 
      couplers.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Rotate the drivers so that the large 
      recesses line up with the pinion shaft holes in the differential 
      case.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. If an axle shaft thrust block is being used, 
      push it into the center of the assembly and line up the large hole with 
      the pinion shaft holes. If in the vehicle, push the right axle shaft 
      inward now, into the coupler splines, to mover the block to the 
      center.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Carefully insert the pinion shaft into the 
      hole and guide it through the drivers, past the spacers (and through the 
      thrust block, if used). It should insert easily by hand. If not, tap it 
      in, being very careful not to get the inner end caught on 
      something!</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Be sure to orient it so that its retaining pin 
      hole will line up with the hole in the differential case (figure 9). If 
      the pinion shaft will not insert, or is hard to insert, be sure that the 
      correct thrust washers are being used and that the spacers are oriented 
      with the widest side (opening) fitting down over the coupler shoulder. 
      Rotate the drivers and couplers back and forth to be sure that they are 
      not binding.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Install the pinion shaft retaining pin. If 
      the pin is solid, as opposed to a roll pin, slightly deform the metal on 
      the side of the hole to help hold it in place (see the shop manual). For 
      C-Clip Axles only: Screw in and tighten the bolt.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. For differential cases out of the vehicle: 
      The case should still be on the bench after the preceding steps; install 
      the ring gear now and torque the bolts. Proceed to the next 
      section.</FONT></P>

      Differential Cases Into Vehicle (thick ring gear; differential case was

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Clean the axle housing interior, cover, 
      mounting surface and drain plug.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Place the correct bearing races onto each 
      end of the differential case.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. If shims are used, locate them near the 
      correct ends of the case, ready to install.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Install the differential case in the carrier 
      as described in the shop manual. Generally, this will involve placing the 
      differential case and correctly located bearing races with one shim into 
      the carrier and then tapping in the shim on the other side, or pressing 
      the case in if the shims are already mounted under the bearings. In some 
      designs a spreader for the housing may be required.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Replace the bearing caps in their marked 
      positions and torque the bolts to their correct value. Consult the shop 
      manual for the exact procedure.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Finish the installation of any remaining 
      parts by reversing the order of disassembly -- in general, the 
      axles/backing plates, brake lines, emergency brake cables, and tires. If 
      your vehicle uses an axle shaft thrust block, be sure that the correct 
      axle shims are in place at the outer ends of the axle shafts. In these 
      designs there should be little or no end play. Also note that in some 
      designs the last 1/8-inch or so of the backing plate installation may be a 
      light press fit and the axle shaft may appear to be hitting something; tap 
      the outside end of the axle shaft and it should go in</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Assembly Inspection</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Inspect your work. Look for anything that is 
      not correct. Be sure that the drivers rotate back and forth smoothly, 
      stopping at the pinion shaft. Use a light to see that the spacers (and 
      thrust block, if used) are in place and that the springs are working 
      properly.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>When the above installation steps are 
      completed, all the parts should be in exactly the same positions as they 
      were when the installation began. If the differential case has been 
      removed from the vehicle, the backlash and pre-load settings should be 
      unchanged from before and no further adjustments will be needed. To be 
      certain, rock the ring gear back and forth to see if the backlash appears 
      to be the same as it was prior to the installation. If not, it will need 
      to be reset with a dial indicator as described in the shop manual. Rotate 
      the ring gear one revolution to be sure that nothing is 
binding.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Your LockRigh installation should now be 
      complete. As a preliminary test only, prior to the final test, rotate the 
      tires back and forth (transmission out of gear and drive shaft free). The 
      drivers should randomly unlock and "click" as the tires move. Note that 
      the tires will NOT lock together -- this easy-unlocking characteristic is 
      a unique feature of the LockRight and is perfectly normal. Watch to be 
      sure that both sets of teeth engage and disengage. If they do, your 
      installation has probably been done correctly and your LockRight is ready 
      for its final test, described in Section 5. Note that the clicking sound 
      is much louder now than what you will hear during driving because the 
      cover is off and no oil is present.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As an additional check to be sure that 
      everything has been installed correctly, use a small ruler, vernier 
      caliper or blade type feeler gauge. The distance between the halves of the 
      LockRight, that is between the two drivers, should be about 5/32-inch 
      (.156-inch, or 3.86-mm). The tolerance limits are between .145-inch (3,68 
      mm) and .170 inch (4.32-mm). If this distance is much over .170-inch, 
      either the case is quite worn or the thrust washers are missing or are too 
      thin and problems should be corrected before proceeding 
further.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Vehicle Final Assembly</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>When everything is correct, clean the axle 
      housing gasket surface and install the cover using a gasket and/or sealant 
      as appropriate, and torque the bolts.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Add gear oil. Note that we suggest using 
      medium-to-heavy oils as recommended by the manufacture, unless the vehicle 
      will be used in very cold weather. Thicker oil, such as 85-140, reduces 
      the "clicking" noise sometimes heard during tight turns and provides 
      adequate lubrication when the assembly becomes hot.</FONT></P>
      <P align=center><B><FONT color=#9999ff face=Arial size=4>Section 4: Tire 
      Diameters</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>To help assure a long life for your LockRight, 
      tire diameters should be as nearly equal as possible. Do not change the 
      inflation pressure to vary the rolling radius of the tire! This practice 
      can be dangerous if one of the tires is under-inflated, producing excess 
      heat, faster tire wear and more difficult vehicle control. The best way to 
      equalize the rotation is measure the circumference of all the tires, 
      including the spare. Choose ones that are within about 3/8-inch or less of 
      each other (do not change form side to side if they are radials). If one 
      tire is much more worn than the other one, they both should be replaced 
      for safety reasons.</FONT></P>
      <P align=center><B><FONT color=#9999ff face=Arial size=4>Section 5: 
      Testing Your Installation</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. Be sure that the vehicle is safely blocked. 
      Leave the axle assembly on the jack stands, with both tires free to rotate 
      and the emergency brake off.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Put the transmission and transfer case in 
      gear to lock the drive shaft.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Rotate one of the tires in the forward 
      direction with your hand until it stops, then hold it. That side of the 
      LockRight is now locked.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Rotate the other tire in the opposite 
      (reverse) direction. The LockRight should "click" as the coupler attached 
      to the axle rotates.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Rotate the first tire in the reverse 
      direction and hold it; repeat step 3, rotating the other tire in the 
      forward direction.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. Repeat steps 2 - 4, rotating and holding the 
      second tire to lock the second side.</FONT></P>

      Driving Your Vehicle</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If the foregoing measurements and test have 
      been successfully completed, apply the emergency brake and remove the 
      vehicle from the jack stands. Your vehicle should now be ready to drive. 
      Carefully read and understand the driving information contained in the 
      LockRight Vehicle Owner's Manual! Safe and effective use of your new

      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>If something is not correct now or if you need 
      to disassemble your LockRight in the future, we will briefly describe the 
      procedure. We will assume that the case has a thin ring gear and remains 
      in the vehicle, or that it has a thick ring gear and has been removed from 
      the vehicle and is on the bench.</FONT></P>
      <P><B><FONT face=Arial size=3>Non-C-Clip Axles</FONT></B></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>1. If the cas will remain in the vehicle (thin 
      ring gear), pull out only the right axle shaft about two inches. Other 
      wise, remove the differential case from the vehicle and place it on the 
      bench.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Remove the pinion shaft retaining pin and 
      the pinion shaft.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Rotate the drives until one of the right 
      window holes faces out. Push under the spring with a small sharp-pointed 
      pick and pry the end up. Push a small screwdriver or bend a piece of small 
      wire (a paper clip works well) under the spring and pop the bottom out. 
      Push the shear pin out of the pin hole and into the window hole. Repeat 
      for the other three springs and pins.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Position the case horizontally and push in 
      the spacers so that they are in the middle of the drivers. If a thrust 
      block is used, push it into the right coupler splines.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Remove the drive and space opposite the ring
