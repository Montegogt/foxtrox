If mouth to mouth ventilation by itself is unsuccessful and the casualty's heart stops, or has stopped beating, you must perform external chest compression in conjunction with mouth to mouth ventilation.This is because without the heart to circulate the blood, oxygenated blood cannot reach the casualty's brain.<BR></FONT>
      <UL>
        <LI>Lay the casualty on their back on a firm 
        surface. Kneel alongside the casualty facing the chest and in line with 
        the heart. Locate the lower half of the breastbone, find the sternal 
        notch at the top and the intersection of the rib margins at the bottom. 
        Place your thumbs midway between these two landmarks to find the 
        center.
        <LI>Place the heel of one hand on the center of 
        the lower half of the breastbone, keeping your fingers off the ribs. 
        Cover this hand with the heel of your other hand and lock your fingers 
        together.

        <LI>Keep your arm straight and move forwards 
        until your arms are vertical. Press down on the lower half of the 
        breastbone ( about 4 to 5 cm, 1.5 to 2 inches for the average adult ). 
        Move back wards to release pressure. Complete fifteen compressions at 
        the rate of eighty compression per minute. (To find the correct speed, 
        count one and two and three, and so on ).

        by two full ventilation, repeating heart check after the first minute.

        <LI>As soon as the heartbeat returns, stop 
        compression immediately. Continue mouth to mouth ventilation until 
        natural breathing is restored, assisting it when necessary, and 
        adjusting it to the casualty's rate. Place the casualty in the recovery 
        position.

When resuscitation is successful, the carotid pulse will return. look at 
the casualty's face and lips. The color will improve as blood containing oxygen 
begins to circulate. When the casualty is not breathing the normal color turns 
blue (cyanosis).

<B><FONT color=#5555ff face=Arial size=4>Resuscitation With Two First Aiders</FONT></B>
<BR>When two first aiders are present, one should take charge and 
maintain the open airway, mouth to mouth ventilation and check heartbeat. The 
other should perform external chest compression. If resuscitation is prolonged 
the first aider can change places to reduce the strain, and it may be easier if 
they work on opposite sides of the body.<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>One first aider takes up a position at the 
  casualty's head , the other kneels alongside the casualty level with the 
  middle of the chest. 
  <LI>The first aider at the head immediately opens 
  the airways, gives the first aider should give five chest 
  compressions.
  <LI>Resuscitation then continues with the first aider 
  at the head opening the airway and giving a single inflation followed by the 
  other giving five compression. This is performed continuously at a rate of 
  sixty compression per minutes until the heartbeat is found. Heartbeat check 
  must be carried out after the first minute and then after every three minutes 
  or twelve cycles.

The 
techniques for resuscitation youths and older children are the same as for 
adults, but they must be done slightly faster and with lighter pressure. For 
children and infants use the techniques described below and place your hand over 
the center of the breast bone for external chest compression.</FONT>
<BR>
<OL>
<B><FONT color=#5555ff face=Arial size=3>For Children:</FONT></B><br>

  <LI>Perform Mouth to Mouth Ventilation by sealing your 
  lips around the child's mouth and nose and breathing gently into the lungs at 
  a rate of 20 breaths per minute. Check for heartbeat after giving the first 
  four inflations.
  <LI>Perform external chest compression with light 
  pressure using one hand only. Press at a rate of 100 compression per minute to 
  a depth of 2.5 to3.5 cm (1 to 1.5 in ) with fifteen compression to two 
  ventilation.

When resuscitating infants give very gentle puffs 
and use very light pressure with two fingers only, apply at a rate of fifteen 
compression to two ventilation.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Perform mouth to mouth ventilation by sealing your 
  lips around the baby's mouth and nose and puffing gently into the lungs at a 
  rate of 20 breaths per minute. Check for heart beat after giving the first 
  four inflations.
  <LI>Perform external chest compression with two 
  fingers pressing at a rate of 100 times per minute to a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 cm 
  (0.5 to 1 in ).
