<FONT face=Arial size=2>First aid is the 
      skilled application of accepted principles of treatment, either at the 
      occurrence of an accident or in a case of sudden illness, using facilities 
      or materials available at the time, because of the increasing numbers and 
      serious nature of accidents of all kinds, the responsibility of the first 
      aider has become greater in recent years. First aid is treatment given to 
      casualty :<BR></FONT>

      breathing, is the process by which passes from the air into the blood 
      while carbon dioxide, a waste product, is expelled. This respiratory 
      exchange of gases takes place in the lungs, atmospheric air which we 
      breathe comprises one fifth oxygen 20%. There is still 16% oxygen in the 
      air we breath out. This accounts for the effectiveness of the expired-air 
      method of resuscitation.</FONT>

      Respiration</FONT></B><BR>Respiration is brought about by the action of 
      the diaphragm and the muscles between the ribs. It consists of three 
      phases, inspiration, expiration and a pause.<BR><FONT 
      color=#00ff00>Inspiration</FONT><BR>The diaphragm contracts and its 
      dome-shaped center becomes flattened, thus increasing the capacity of the 
      muscles attached to them, thus increasing the capacity of the chest from 
      front to back and from side to side. In inspiration, air is draw into the 
      lungs by muscular activity as described above.<BR><B><FONT 
      color=#00ff00>Expiration</FONT></B><BR>In expiration, air is forced out 
      through the bronchi and trachea by the relaxation of the diaphragm and the 
      return of the ribs to their normal position. This is achieved by the 
      elastic contraction of the lungs. Their is a short puss before inspiration 
      recommences. This movements are controlled by respiratory centers in the 
      mid brain which react to variations in the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
      blood.<BR><BR>
