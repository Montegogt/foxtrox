        <H2>Winch Essentials</H2>
        <P>Of all the different properties of a given winch, the line pull 
        rating is the most important. It is the maximum static load the winch 
        can exert on the cable. This will be achieved on the first wrap of the 
        cable on the drum. For every successive wrap of cable on the drum the 
        winch's torque decreases 12%. This must be taken into account when 
        selecting a winch for your 4X4. 
        <P>The line pull, line speed, and current draw (applicable only to an 
        Electric Winch; a Hydraulic winch does not have this problem) indicates 
        when a weight of X lbs is pulled, it will be pulled at Y ft/min using Z 
        amps. These numbers vary widely from winch to winch. They should be an 
        important consideration in a winch purchase. It is best to ask an 
        experienced winch owner to determine what is best for you. 
        <P>Weight is an indicator of the constuction of the winch. Winches must 
        be very STRONG. Too little weight means too little metal used in the 
        construction. Too much weight could mean that your front end will sag. A 
        benefit of the Hydraulic winch is that it does weigh less.

            <TD><B>Q. How do I select a winch for my truck?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> The most important thing to consider when selecting 
              a winch is whether it is capable of pulling 1.5 times the gross 
              vehicle weight (GVW) of your vehicle (don't forget to take into 
              account that 12% drop in pulling power for every extra wrap of 
              cable on the drum - a 9000lb winch has a line pull of approx. 
              7000lbs on the third wrap). GVW is the real world weight of your 
              vehicle, i.e. fully loaded. So fill up your gas tank, load up all 
              those off-road goodies, tools, hi-lift jacks, people and go get 
              your vehicle weighed. </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. What do the different winch gear systems mean and what 
              difference will they make when I'm operating them?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> There are three common gearing systems, worm gear, 
              spur gear and planetary gear. They all do the same job, gear down 
              the high speed motor to a low speed high torque winch drum. The 
              gear reduction ratio is by how much the motor's output revolutions 
              are reduced for the spindle. The greater the reduction, the more 
              revolutions the motor has to turn for one spindle revolution and 
              the less the motor has to work for that revolution. The difference 
              in the gearing systems is mainly in their transfer efficiency. 
              <P>The worm gear has a transfer effiency of 35-40%. This causes 
              the winch to be self-braking even under heavy loads, but this 
              means the unit will need a clutch mechanism for free spooling. 
              Worm gears offer the most reduction, very high reliability, 
              built-in braking mechnism, and generally a slower winching speed. 
              <P>The spur and planetary gear systems have efficiencies of 75% 
              and 65% respectively. This means they have a tendency to free 
              spool when loaded, therefore a braking mechanism is needed. 
              Planatary gears are the most common and provide both strength and 
              smooth operation with good resistance to torque loads. </P></TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. I've noticed while looking through the manufacturer's 
              catalogs that there are different types of electric motors. What 
              is the difference between series wound motors and permanent magnet 
              motors? Is one better than the other?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> An electric motor basically has two major parts, the 
              stator and the rotor (or armature). It is the job of the stator to 
              produce a magnetic field which will cause the rotor to rotate when 
              an electric current flows through it. 
              <P>In a permanent magnet motor, the stator uses permanent magnets. 
              This means the current drain on the battery is lower than series 
              wound motors (which uses field coils in the stator). Permanent 
              magnet motors are good for light and medium duty winches, but 
              winching time and load has to be carefully monitored as they tend 
              to overheat. Series wound motors are used in heavier duty winches, 
              but tend to cost more. </P></TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. Will my electrical system cope with the extra load of an 
              electrical winch?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> For most pulls, yes. There a lot of people out there 
              with one battery, stock alternator, and a winch. Keep in mind 
              though that running a winch is the equivalent to moving your truck 
              on the starter motor, there is a tremendous draw. Most electric 
              winches draw around 400 amps at full load which is far more than 
              even a high output alternator will produce. Stock alternators 
              typically produce 40-90 amps at peak output and the battery will 
              keep up for only so long. Because of this, many people install 
              high output alternators and dual battery systems to support an 
              electric winch. 
              <P>When shopping for a high output alternators, remember to 
              consider alternator output at idle, these figures can differ 
              wildly, especially on older models. Regardless of what alternator 
              you have, it is a good idea to keep up the RPMs while you are 
              winching if possible. Most alternators have peak outputs near 
              cruising RPMS. Also, keep you truck running after winching to give 
              your battery time to recover. 
              <P>Upgrading the battery or going to a dual battery system is also 
              a good idea. The more cold cranking amps your battery (or 
              batteries) produces, the longer you can pull without your engine 
              running. An electronic battery management system is also a good 
              idea to issolate the batteries. 
              <P>After you have got power to the winch you will need to get it 
              back to the battery. Ensure your grounding system is capable and 
              all connections are clean, this is where most systems waste power. 
              The best grounding systems will use large diameter cables (such as 
              welding cables), the battery negative post connects to the engine 
              block, the alternator ground connects to the engine (usually 
              through its case) and then the frame is connected to the engine 
              using a grounding strap. The best bet is to connect the a ground 
              directly from the winch to the battery. </P></TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. I want to be able to winch from either the front or the 
              back of my truck, are the receiver mounted winches any good?</B> 
            </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> Receiver mounted winches are very useful, but 
              remember their static pull load is limited by the receiver they 
              fit into. For a class III hitch that is 5000lbs. Because of this, 
              receiver mounted winches are not really suitable for full sized 
              trucks. </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. When I buy my winch, what comes with it, and what else 
              do I need to start using it?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> Most winches come with nothing, but some places do a 
              deal which includes the remote cable control and fairlead hawser. 
              You will also need the mounting kit for your vehicle. I strongly 
              recommend you buy the winch manufacturers kit. It has been 
              designed for that winch and vehicle with all safety aspects 
              considered. Home made winch mounts are disasters looking for a 
              place to happen. 
              <P>Your winch will now work, but it is limited to straight line 
              pulls between two vehicles. The addition of the following items 
              will greatly increase your winch's usefulness - Tree saver straps 
              (never wrap a cable directly round a tree, you will kill the tree 
              and kink your cable), a couple of clevis pins, snatch blocks, a 
              choke chain and of course thick leather gloves. 
              <P>Attach tow hooks to the frame on all four corners of your 
              vehicle. </P></TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. What safety equipment will I need?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> You just need your leather gloves and common sense. 
              Never handle the cable with bare hands, a frayed cable can cut 
              skin to the bone. The most common winch accident is getting your 
              fingers caught in the cable as the last of it winds onto the drum. 
              Always use the remote control cable when winching, and keep every 
              one out of range of the cable . </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. What other safety considerations are there?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> Be aware that a broken winch cable can have enough 
              force in its whiplash to cut through a truck's roof and 
              windshield. Imagine what would happen if the cable met a person. A 
              cable that hits a small tree will tear the tree down. A cable that 
              hits a large tree can wrap tightly around a tree so a person 
              behind the tree is not necessarily safe. Solid objects such as 
              hooks and snatch blocks will fly through anything, including a 
              truck's hood, if a cable breaks. People should stand well out of 
              range of the cable and never in line with the cable. Furthermore, 
              if a cable breaks, the truck being winched may roll downhill, so 
              never stand downhill of any vehicle being winched. </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. Is it common to break a winch cable? Should I carry a 
              spare?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> No to both questions. A properly maintained cable is 
              very reliable (see question about maintenance) and carrying a 
              spare will only increase the risk of damaging it. Winch cable is 
              aircraft grade cable and has a breaking strain of 32,000lbs - much 
              higher than the capacity of the winch. 
              <P>It is much more common for for snatch blocks and anchor points 
              to break because they were poorly rigged up. It is a good idea to 
              drape a heavy cloth jacket over the cable to limit the whiplash if 
              something snaps. If someone has to steer the vehicle being 
              winched, then raise the hood for extra protection. Ensure all 
              anchor points are firm. </P></TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>Q. Is my winch maintenance free?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> Although many people seem to think the answer to 
              this one is yes, the answer is really no! I have met a number of 
              people in the mountains stuck, with a winch that won't work. A 
              little care and preventative maintenance would have ensured its 
              reliability. 
              <P>Your winch should be maintained on a regular basis. Lubricate 
              all required points, inspect all mounts, pulleys, straps and 
              clevis pins, check they are not damaged, or showing signs of 
              fatigue, and are free of moisture. Inspect your remote control 
              lead and electrical system for damage and chaffed insulation. Make 
              sure all terminals are corrosion free and tight. After each trip 
              unspool the cable. Check for kinks and frayed strands (damaged 
              cables should be replaced). Lubricate cable with a chain and cable 
              lubricant (normal grease will collect dirt) and wind back onto

            <TD><B>Q. What does using a snatch block achieve?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> Basically it doubles your available pulling power 
              (in fact it's an increase of 85% after safety considerations). It 
              will also allow you to perform pulls at an angle to your truck. 
              People are rarely considerate enough to get stuck straight in 
              front of you. </TD></TR>

            <TD><B>Q. When I double up the winch line using the snatch block, 
              where should I attach the return line.</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> If the snatch block is attached to another vehicle, 
              which you are trying to free, then the return line should be 
              connected to a third vehicle or tree, to spread the load. 
              <P>If the snatch block is anchored to a tree and you are trying to 
              free yourself, then the return line should be hooked onto your 
              vehicle's frame. DO NOT hook it back on to the winch mount as this 
              will effectively double the load on the mounting plate. </P></TD></TR>

            <TD><B>Q. What is the best way of anchoring my vehicle when I'm 
              trying to winch another vehicle out of trouble?</B> </TD></TR>
          <TR>
            <TD><B>A.</B> Anchor your vehicle to another vehicle or any other 
              fixed object using your tow strap, tree saver, choker chain etc. 
              The one thing to remember is attach the anchor strap to your 
              vehicle at the same end as your winch, otherwise you may stretch 
              your vehicle's frame. Often, simply hitting the brakes will be 
              sufficient to hold your vehicle in place. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
        <H3>Electric vs. Hydraulic vs. PTO</H3>
        <P>Just when everyone thought the electric vs. PTO winch war was over, 
        along comes the hydraulic winch. There are still pockets of resistence, 
        but generally, electric winches have won out over the PTO winch. Enter 
        the hydraulic winches and another set of advantages and disadvantages. 
        <P>The PTO (Power Take Off) winch is driven by a small drive shaft that 
        is driven by a PTO adapter that bolts to the transmission or transfer 
        case. Only certain transmissions and transfer cases have PTO ports (e.g. 
        T-18, SM-465, Dana 18, ...). Most electric and hydraulic winches have 
        only one speed, but with a transfer case PTO port, shifting gears can be 
        used to change line speed, torque, and direction. Transmission PTO ports 
        drive off the counter shaft, so they work in one direction and have one 
        speed that can be varied by engine RPM. Since engine power drives the 
        PTO winch, your engine must be working to operate a PTO winch. This is 
        probably the biggest disadvantage of the PTO winch since your engine 
        isn't likely to be running for long when your truck is upside down or 
        under water in a raging river. Not long enough to run out the cable 
        anyway. 
        <P>The electric winch does not require the engine to be running to work, 
        which is it's biggest advantage. The big argument against the electric 
        winch in the past was it would drain you battery and there was no way 
        your alternator could provide sufficient power for a long pull. The 
        automotive industry has made great improvements in alternator and 
        battery technology over the past years which has given the advantage to 
        the electric winch. Batteries have more power and alternators have 
        higher outputs. An electric winch <I>might</I> even work if your truck 
        is upsidedown or under water. 
        <P>Some of the advantages of the hydraulic winch are pulling power, pull 
        duration, and weight. The hydraulic winch runs off your existing power 
        steering pump. There is no need to upgrade alternator of battery for the 
        winch, but you may consider upgrading your power steering pump. If you 
        don't have power steering, convert now, regardless of what winch you 
        get. A hydraulic winch should be able to pull harder and longer than a 
        electric winch with out over heating. Hydraulic winches are also much 
        lighter than electric winches, putting less strain on your front axle 
        and front springs. 
        <P>Hydraulic winches suffer from the same disadvantage as the PTO winch, 
        neither works when the engine isn't running. The hydraulic winches I've 
        seen have a real slow line speed, this could an advantage under some 
        circumstances, but generally this is a disadvantage. There is a two 
        speed model, but the high speed is not for use under load. Another 
        disadvantage I've heard from people with hydraulic winches is the 
        reduced ability to steer and winch at the same time.</P>
