Einstein wrote this riddle in this century. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. There are no tricks – just pure logic, so don’t give up.<br><br>
1. There are 5 houses in five colors in a row.<br>
2. In each house lives a person with a different nationality.<br>
3. These five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and deep a certain pet.<br>
4. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage.<br><br>
The question: Who owns the fish?<br><br>
