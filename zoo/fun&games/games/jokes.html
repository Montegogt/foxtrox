<li>Three blondes are sitting by the side of a river holding fishing poles with the lines in the water. A Game Warden comes up behind them, taps them on the shoulder and says, "Excuse me, ladies, I'd like to see your fishing licenses."<br>
"We don't have any." replied the first blonde.<br>
"Well, if your going to fish, you need fishing licenses." said the Game Warden.<br>
"But officer," replied the second blonde, "we aren't fishing. We all have magnets at the end of our lines and we're collecting debris off the bottom of the river."<br>
The Game Warden lifted up all the lines and, sure enough, there were horseshoe magnets tied on the end of each line. "Well, I know of no law against it," said the Game Warden, "take all the debris you want." And with that, the Game Warden left.<br>
As soon as the Game Warden was out of sight, the three blondes started laughing hysterically. "What a dumb Fish Cop," the second blonde said to the other two, "doesn't he know that there are steelhead in this river?!"<br><br>


<li>A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire
herself out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy
neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the
owner if he had any jobs for her to do. "Well, you can paint my porch.
How much will you charge?"<br>
The blonde said "How about 50 dollars?" The man agreed and told her
that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The
man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her
husband, "Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the
house?"<br>
The man replied, "She should. She was standing on the porch." A short
time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money. "You're
finished already?" he asked. "Yes," the blonde answered, "and I had
paint left over, so I gave it two coats." Impressed, the man reached
in his pocket for the $50.<br>
"And by the way," the blonde added, "that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari."

<li>A little kid is at his first wedding, and he says to his mother,<br> “Why is the bride dressed in white?”<br>
His mother says, “Because white is the color of happiness, and today is the happiest day of her life.”<br>
The kid says, “So why is the groom wearing black?”<br><br>


<LI>Philosophy<br>A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2" in diameter. He then asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The students laughed. The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.  The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else, the small stuff.  If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you.  Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal. Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand." But then...A student then took the jar which the other students and the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour in a glass of beer. Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full. The moral of this tale is: no matter how full your life is, there is always room for BEER.<br><br>

<li>Aim High, drink beer!<BR>A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo, and when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole keeps improving by the regular culling of the weakest members.
In much the same way, the human brain can operate only as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills off brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.
The results of this in-depth epidemiological study verifies and validates the causal link between all-weekend parties and engineering performance. It also explains why, after a few short years of leaving university and getting married, most engineers cannot keep up with the performance of the new graduates. Only those few that stick to the strict regimen of voracious alcoholic consumption can maintain the intellectual levels that they achieved during their university years.
So, this is a call to arms. As our country is losing its technological edge we should not shudder in our homes. Get back into the bars! Quaff that beer! Your company and country need you to be at your peak, and you shouldn't deny yourself the career that you could have.
Aim High, drink beer!<br><br>

<li>Soap & Water<br>A priest was asked to dinner by one of his parishoners who he knew as being an unkempt housekeeper. When he sat down at the table, he noticed that the dishes were the dirtiest that he had ever seen in his life.
"Were these dishes ever washed?" he asked his hostess, running his fingers over the grit and grime.
She replied, "They're as clean as soap and water could get them".
He felt a bit apprehensive but blessed the food anyway and started eating. It was really delicious and he said so, despite the dirty dishes.
When dinner was over, the hostess took the dishes outside and barked, "Here Soap! Here Water!"<br><br>

<li>Elephant & Crow<br>Q. What do you get when you cross an elephant with a crow?<br>A. Downed power lines.<br><br>

<li>Be Careful What You Ask For<br>A supposedly true story ...<br>
In the weeks before Christmas the British ambassador in Canada received a phone call from the CBC (CBC Canadian Broadcasting Company, a Canadian TV station). The CBC representative on the other end of the line thanked the ambassador for his prompt arrival at interviews etc, and for a generally good year. The ambassador returned the thanks. The CBC representative then asked the ambassador what he wanted for Christmas.<br>
Thinking that it might be inappropriate for him to accept a gift, the ambassador said that he didn't think that it was a very good idea. However, The CBC representative insisted, and in the end the ambassador said that he wanted a small box of crystallised fruits.<br>
The CBC rep seemed a little puzzled at this answer, but they ended the conversation and the ambassador thought nothing more of it.<br>
Later that month, on Boxing Day, the ambassador was sitting watching the news on TV with his family when he was treated to this item at the end:<br>
"Before Christmas, we asked three foreign ambassadors what they wanted for Christmas. The French ambassador said that he wanted world peace and an end to suffering, the German ambassador said that he wanted a cure for cancer, and the British ambassador said that he wanted a small box of crystallised fruits...."<br><br>

<li>Three Little Pigs<br>
Three Little Pigs went out to dinner one night. The waiter comes and takes their drink order.<br>
"I would like a Sprite," said the first little piggy.<br>
"I would like a Coke," said the second little piggy.<br>
"I want water, lots and lots of water," said the third little piggy.<br>
The drinks are brought out and the waiter takes their orders for dinner.<br>
"I want a nice big steak," said the first piggy.<br>
"I would like the salad plate," said the second piggy.<br>
"I want water, lots and lots of water," said the third little piggy.<br>
The meals were brought out and a while later the waiter approached the table and asked if the piggies would like any dessert.<br>
"I want a banana split," said the first piggy.<br>
"I want a root beer float," said the second piggy.<br>
"I want water, lots and lots of water," exclaimed the third little piggy.<br>
"Pardon me for asking," said the waiter, "but why have you only ordered water ???"<br>
The third piggy says - "Well, somebody has to go 'Wee, wee, wee, all the way home!'"<br><br>



<li>Ice Fisher<br>
A blonde decided she needed something new and different for a winter hobby. She went to the bookstore and bought every book she could find on
ice fishing. For weeks she read and studied every book, hoping to become an expert in the field and show people blondes are not as dumb as the think.
Finally she decided she knew enough, and out she went for her first ice fishing trip.<br>
She carefully gathered up and packed all the tools and equipment needed for the excursion. Each piece of equipment had its own special place in her kit.
When she got to the ice, she found a quiet little area, placed her padded stool, and carefully laid out her tools. Just as she was about to make her first cut into the ice, a booming voice from the sky bellowed, "There are no fish under the ice!"<br>
Startled, the blonde grabbed up all her belongings, moved further along the ice, poured some hot chocolate from her thermos, and started to cut a new hole. Again the voice from above bellowed, "There are no fish under the ice!"<br>
Amazed, the blonde wasn't quite sure what to do, as this certainly wasn't covered in any of her books. She packed up her gear and moved to the far side of the ice. Once there, she stopped for a few moments to regain her calm. Then she was extremely careful to set everything up perfectly -- tools in the right place, chair positioned just so, everything. Just as she was about to cut this new hole, the voice came again, "There are no fish under the ice!"<br>
Petrified, the blonde looked skyward and asked "Is that you Lord?"<br>
The voice boomed back, "No, this is the manager of the skating rink!"<br><br>


<li>The Compassionate Attorney<br>
One afternoon, a wealthy lawyer was riding in the back of his limousine when he saw two men eating grass by the road side. He ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate.<br>
"Why are you eating grass!?!" he asked one man.<br>
"We don't have any money for food," the poor man replied.<br>
"Oh, come along with me then," instructed the lawyer.<br>
"But, sir, I have a wife and two children!"<br>
"Bring them along!" replied the lawyer. He turned to the other man and said, "Come with us."<br>
"But sir, I have a wife and six children!" the second man answered.<br>
"Bring them as well!" answered the lawyer as he headed for his limo.<br>
They all climbed into the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limo.<br>
Once underway, one of the poor fellows says, "Sir, you are too kind. Thank you for taking all of us with you."<br>
The lawyer replied, "No problem, the grass at my home is almost a foot tall."<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take One<br>
Two engineering students were walking across campus when one said, "Where did you get such a great bike?" The second engineer replied, "Well, I was walking along yesterday minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up on this bike.  She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want." The second engineer nodded approvingly, "Good choice; the clothes probably wouldn't have fitted."<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take Two<br>
To the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take Three<br>
A pastor, a doctor and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's with these guys? We must have been waiting for 15 minutes!" The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such ineptitude! "The pastor said, "Hey, here comes the greens keeper. Let's have a word with him." [dramatic pause]<br>
"Hi George. Say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?" The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind fire-fighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime."<br>
The group was silent for a moment.  The pastor said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight."<br>
The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."<br>
The engineer said, "Why can't these guys play at night?"<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take Four<br>
There was an engineer who had an exceptional gift for fixing all things mechanical. After serving his company loyally for over 30 years, he happily retired. Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multimillion dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine to work but to no avail. In desperation, they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past. The engineer reluctantly took the challenge. He spent a day studying the huge machine. At the end of the day, he marked a small "x" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and stated, "This is where your problem is". The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again.<br>
The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service. They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges.   The engineer responded briefly: One chalk mark $1. Knowing where to put it $49,999.<br>
It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace.<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take Five<br>
What is the difference between Mechanical Engineers and Civil Engineers? <br>
Mechanical Engineers build weapons.  Civil Engineers build targets. <br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take Six<br>
Three engineering students were gathered together discussing the possible designers of the human body.<br>
One said, "It was a mechanical engineer. Just look at all the joints." <br>
Another said, "No, it was an electrical engineer. The nervous system has many thousands of electrical  connections." <br>
The last said, "Actually it was a civil engineer. Who else would run a toxic waste pipeline through a recreational area?" <br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers - Take Seven<br>
Normal people ... believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br> Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet."<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers- Take Eight<br>
An architect, an artist and an engineer were discussing whether it was better to spend time with the wife or a mistress.<br>
The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship.<br>
The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the passion and mystery he found there.<br>
The engineer said, "I like both."   "Both?"   Engineer: "Yeah. If you have both a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the lab and get some work done."<br><br>

<li>Comprehending Engineers- Take Nine<br>
An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him and said, "If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess". He bent over, picked up the frog and put it in his pocket. <br>
The frog spoke up again and said, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week." The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket. The frog then cried out, "If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, I'll stay with you and do ANYTHING you want."  Again the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket. <br>
Finally, the frog asked, "What is the matter? I've told you I'm a beautiful princess, that I'll stay with you for a week and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?" <br>
The engineer said, "Look I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend - but a talking frog, now that's cool." <br><br>
