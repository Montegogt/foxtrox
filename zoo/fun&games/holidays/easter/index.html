            <P><B><FONT size=+1>The greatest festival of the Christian church 
            commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is a movable 
            feast; that is, it is not always held on the same date. In AD 325 
            the church council of Nicaea decided that it should be celebrated on 
            the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal 
            equinox of March 21. Easter can come as early as March 22 or as late 
            as April 25. </FONT></B></P>

            <P><B><FONT size=+1>Connected with the observance of Easter are the 
            40-day penitential season of Lent, beginning on Ash Wednesday and 
            concluding at midnight on Holy Saturday, the day before Easter 
            Sunday. In many churches Easter is preceded by a season of prayer, 
            abstinence, and fasting. This is observed in memory of the 40 days' 
            fast of Christ in the desert. In Eastern Orthodox churches Lent is 
            50 days. In Western Christendom Lent is observed for six weeks and 
            four days. </FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT size=+1>Lent may be preceded by a carnival season. The 
            origin of the word carnival is probably from the Latin carne vale, 
            meaning flesh (meat), farewell. Elaborate pageants often close this 
            season on Shrove Tuesday, the day before the beginning of Lent. This 
            day is also called by its French name, Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday). 
            </FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT size=+1>Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, gets its 
            name from the practice, mainly in the Roman Catholic church, of 
            putting ashes on the foreheads of the faithful to remind them that 
            man is but dust.</FONT></B></P>

            <P><B><FONT size=+1>Palm Sunday, one week before Easter, celebrates 
            the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. Holy Week begins on this day. 
            Holy Thursday, or Maundy Thursday, is in memory of the Last Supper 
            of Christ with his disciples. Good Friday commemorates the 
            crucifixion. </FONT></B></P>

            <P><B><FONT size=+1>Many Easter customs come from the Old World. The 
            white lily, the symbol of the resurrection, is the special Easter 
            flower. Rabbits and colored eggs have come from pagan antiquity as 
            symbols of new life. The Easter rabbit, a symbol of fertility, and 
            in colored easter eggs, originally painted with bright colors to 
            represent the sunlight of spring, and used in Easter-egg rolling 
            contests or given as gifts. Easter Monday egg rolling, a custom of 
            European origin, has become a tradition on the lawn of the White 
            House in Washington, D.C. During the Octave of Easter in early 
            Christian times, the newly baptized wore white garments, white being 
            the liturgical color of Easter and signifying light, purity, and 
            joy. <A

            <P><B><FONT color=#ffff00><FONT size=+2>ORIGIN OF THE 
            NAME</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>
            <P><B><FONT size=+1>The name Easter comes from Eostre, an ancient 
            Anglo-Saxon goddess, originally of the dawn. In pagan times an 
            annual spring festival was held in her honor. Some Easter customs 
            have come from this and other pre-Christian spring festivals. Others 
            come from the Passover feast of the Jews, observed in memory of 
            their deliverance from Egypt. The word paschal comes from a Latin 
            word that means belonging to Passover or to Easter. Formerly, Easter 
            and the Passover were closely associated. </FONT></B></P>
            <P><B><FONT size=+1>The resurrection of Jesus took place during the 
            Passover. Christians of the Eastern church initially celebrated both 
            holidays together. But the Passover can fall on any day of the week, 
            and Christians of the Western church preferred to celebrate Easter 
            on Sunday the day of the resurrection. </FONT></B></P>

            <P><B><FONT size=+1><u>FOOT WASHING</u>
            <br>During Christ's time, people wore sandals and had to walk many 
            miles each day on dusty road. It was courtesy and respect for a 
            servant to wash the feet of guests when they arrived. Jesus washed 
            the feet of all his disciples the night before he was crucified. 
            This gesture was to show his disciples that he was their servant and 
            he respected them. It was also to show them that in order to be good 
            leaders, they must show respect to their followers and be willing to 
            serve. 
            <br>Kings and Lords during medieval times followed Jesus' example. 
            They did this by washing the feet of twelve of the poorest men in 
            their kingdom on the Thursday before Easter. In England, it was 
            custom for kings and queens to wash the feet of as many poor people 
            as they were in years old. This custom is still practiced by Queen 
            Elizabeth today.
 
            <P><B><FONT size=+1><u>MAKING AN EASTER TREE</u>
            <br>The making of an Easter tree is an old custom in Germany, Holland 
            and some other European countries. They brought this custom to the 
            United States when they came. Days before Easter, these Europeans 
            would bring in bare branches and put them in a pot filled with 
            earth. The children will then decorate them with decorated empty 
            eggs. They did this by emptying the eggs, dyed them and then used 
            ribbons to tie and hang them on the bare branches. The bare branches 
            symbolize death while the eggs are a symbol of life.

            <P><B><FONT size=+1><u>EASTER EGG HUNTING</u>
            <br>Easter egg hunt is common all over the world. Eggs are hidden by 
            adults and the children hunts and collects them. The one with the 
            most eggs is the winner.
 
            <P><B><FONT size=+1><u>EASTER EGG ROLLING</u>
            <br>This custom was started in Europe a long time ago. Contestants 
            rolled their eggs on gentle slopes toward the finish line at the 
            bottom of the hill. The first unbroken egg over the line is the 
            winner. An annual egg roll was started in the United States during 
            President Andrew Johnson's period. The White House south lawn now is 
            the site of the Easter Monday Egg Roll. Many children participate in 
            this yearly event.
