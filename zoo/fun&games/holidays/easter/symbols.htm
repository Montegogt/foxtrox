            <P>As Christianity spread, more familiar traditions, symbols and 
            celebrations of spring were associated with Easter - Christ coming 
            back to life after death. One of the oldest spring symbols in the 
            world is the egg. The oval shape of the egg was the same shape for a 
            raindrop and a seed. These two were important life-giving elements. 
            The egg itself promises new life as in spring, birds, and many other 
            animals are hatched from eggs. In fact, the Persians, Hindus and 
            Egyptians believed that the world began with a single egg. In 
            ancient China, Rome and Greece, eggs were given as springtime gifts. 
            In Polland and Russia, hours are spent on drawing intricate designs 
            on Easter eggs. In England, members of the royal families gave each 
            other gold-covered eggs as Easter gifts in the middle ages. The most 
            famous Easter egg decorator was <A 
            href="http://users.vnet.net/schulman/Faberge/bio.html#TOP">Peter 
            Carl Faberge</A>. He designed eggs from gold, silver and other 
            precious gems for kings of Europe and czars of Russia. These eggs 
            are priceless now and can only be found in museums and private 
            collections. In early America, children decorated their eggs by 
            using dyes made from natural materials like fruit and leave 
            coloring.

            </FONT></B>
            <P>The Celts, a prehistoric race or people, practiced a religion 
            called Druidism. They believed in good and evil spirits. It was 
            believed that evil spirits captured the sun god and that was why 
            there was winter. Every beginning of Spring, they would lit up huge 
            bonfires to frighten away the evil spirits into releasing the sun. 
            The lighting of bonfires are still a part of Easter celebrations in 
            some countries today such as in Germany and Belgium. Today, bonfires 
            represent the light coming to the world through Christ. The candle 
            is also used as a symbol of the light of Christ.

            </FONT></B>
            <P>In ancient Rome, people thought a goddess Flora made the flowers 
            bloom. They celebrated the Festival of Floralia by having big 
            parades and carried garlands of blossoms throught the streets to 
            honor her every Spring. The statues of Flora were decorated with 
            flowers. 
            <P>In ancient Greek , people believed that the goddess Demeter's 
            daughter was kidnapped while picking the flower narcissus. She was 
            allowed to visit her mother only during spring and summer. The 
            Greeks believed that this made Demeter really happy and made the 
            flowers bloom. They thought that winter is caused by her sadness 
            when her daughter went away again. This flower thus hold a special 
            meaning to the Greeks. The narcissus is also a favorite Easter 
            flower in many parts of the world because of its bright and fragrant 
            blossoms. The Easter lily is a new but popular easter flower. The <A 
            href="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/publications/lily/lily.html">easter 
            lily</A> was brought into the United States in 1882 from Bermuda. 
            They serve as a reminder of the purity of Christ.

            width=102> <FONT color=lightgreen size=4><B>CROSS </FONT></B>
            <P>The cross was also a well-known symbol before the time of Christ. 
            It was used a special mark on clothes and buildings. However, when 
            Jesus was crucified, the cross became a symbol of suffering. Then 
            with the resurrection of Christ, the Christians saw it as a symbol 
            of Jesus's victory over death. In A.D. 325, Constantine at the 
            Council of Nicaea issued a decree that the Cross is the official 
            symbol of Christianity. 
            <P><FONT color=lightgreen size=4><B>PALM </FONT></B>
            <P>It was a Roman custom to welcome royalty by waving palm branches. 
            When Jesus arrived in Jerusalem on the first Palm Sunday, people 
            welcomed him with palm branches carpeting the streets and waving 
            them. Today, on Palm Sunday, Christians would carry palm branches in 
            parades, make them into crosses and garlands to decorate the Church.

            color=lightgreen size=4><B>EASTER BUNNY </FONT></B>
            <P>European legend says that the hare never closed its eyes and 
            watch the other animals throughout the night. It became a symbol of 
            the moon. The hare is connected with Easter because the celebration 
            date depends upon the full moon. 
            <P>In Egypt, people used to believe that the rabbit was responsible 
            for the new life in spring. Later, early Christians saw it as a 
            symbol for the resurrection of Christ. 
            <P>According to an old German story, a poor woman hid some brightly 
            colored eggs in her garden as Easter treats for children. While the 
            children were searching, a hare hopped past. The children thought 
            that the hare had left the eggs. So every Easter, German children 
            would make nests of leaves and branches in their gardens for the 
            hare. This custom was brought to the United States when the Germans 
            came. The hare became a rabbit because there were more rabbits in 
            the United States. Today, it is called the Easter bunny. 
            <P>In England, the goddess of spring, Eastre had an earthly symbol 
            which was the rabbit. She was worship by the Anglo-Saxons through 
            her earthly symbol. 
            <P>The Easter bunny also has to do with its pre-Christian origin. 
            The hare were very fertile animals and gave birth to many offsprings 
            in spring. Therefore , the bunny served as a symbol of new life 
            during the Spring season.

            CROSS BUNS) </FONT></B>
            <P>The lamb was often sacrificed as offerings to God by the Hebrews 
            long before the first Passover. When Jesus died, he gave himself as 
            an offering to God for the sins of the world. Early Christians then 
            saw the lamb as a symbol of Jesus and used it for Easter 
            celebration. Many people serve lamb as part of the Easter feast. 
            <P>Other food served on Easter are <A 
            href="http://breadrecipe.com/az/BakedPretzels.asp">Pretzels</A> <IMG 
            align=right height=94 src="pretzels.gif" width=119>, a 
            Lenten food. The twisted shaped symbolizes arms crossed in prayer. 
            <P>In Great Britain people have always enjoyed the traditional Good 
            Friday breakfast of hot cross buns. They are also served throughout 
            Easter. Each bun has an icing cross on top to remind people of 
            Christ. Street vendors used to used to sing a song when they went 
            around selling their hot cross buns. This song is now a favorite 
            nursery rhyme for children.
