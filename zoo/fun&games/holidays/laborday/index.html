      <P><FONT class=headersm>Labor Day: How it Came About; What it 
      Means</FONT><BR><BR></P>
      <P align=left>"Labor Day differs in every essential way from the other 
      holidays of the year in any country," said Samuel Gompers, founder and 
      longtime president of the American Federation of Labor. "All other 
      holidays are in a more or less degree connected with conflicts and battles 
      of man's prowess over man, of strife and discord for greed and power, of 
      glories achieved by one nation over another. Labor Day...is devoted to no 
      man, living or dead, to no sect, race, or nation." </P>
      <P align=left>Labor Day, the first Monday in September, is a creation of 
      the labor movement and is dedicated to the social and economic 
      achievements of American workers. It constitutes a yearly national tribute 
      to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and 
      well-being of our country. </P>
      <P><FONT class=headersm>Founder of Labor Day</FONT><BR><BR></P>
      <P align=left>More than 100 years after the first Labor Day observance, 
      there is still some doubt as to who first proposed the holiday for 
      workers. </P>
      <P align=left>Some records show that Peter J. McGuire, general secretary 
      of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a cofounder of the 
      American Federation of Labor, was first in suggesting a day to honor those 
      "who from rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold." 
      </P>
      <P align=left>But Peter McGuire's place in Labor Day history has not gone 
      unchallenged. Many believe that Matthew Maguire, a machinist, not Peter 
      McGuire, founded the holiday. Recent research seems to support the 
      contention that Matthew Maguire, later the secretary of Local 344 of the 
      International Association of Machinists in Paterson, N.J., proposed the 
      holiday in 1882 while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union in 
      New York. What is clear is that the Central Labor Union adopted a Labor 
      Day proposal and appointed a committee to plan a demonstration and picnic. 
      </P>
      <P><FONT class=headersm>The First Labor Day</FONT><BR><BR></P>
      <P align=left>The first Labor Day holiday was celebrated on Tuesday, 
      September 5, 1882, in New York City, in accordance with the plans of the 
      Central Labor Union. The Central Labor Union held its second Labor Day 
      holiday just a year later, on September 5, 1883. </P>
      <P align=left>In 1884 the first Monday in September was selected as the 
      holiday, as originally proposed, and the Central Labor Union urged similar 
      organizations in other cities to follow the example of New York and 
      celebrate a "workingmen's holiday" on that date. The idea spread with the 
      growth of labor organizations, and in 1885 Labor Day was celebrated in 
      many industrial centers of the country. </P>
      <P><FONT class=headersm>Labor Day Legislation</FONT><BR><BR></P>
      <P align=left>Through the years the nation gave increasing emphasis to 
      Labor Day. The first governmental recognition came through municipal 
      ordinances passed during 1885 and 1886. From them developed the movement 
      to secure state legislation. The first state bill was introduced into the 
      New York legislature, but the first to become law was passed by Oregon on 
      February 21, 1887. During the year four more states — Colorado, 
      Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York — created the Labor Day holiday by 
      legislative enactment. By the end of the decade Connecticut, Nebraska, and 
      Pennsylvania had followed suit. By 1894, 23 other states had adopted the 
      holiday in honor of workers, and on June 28 of that year, Congress passed 
      an act making the first Monday in September of each year a legal holiday 
      in the District of Columbia and the territories. </P>
      <P><FONT class=headersm>A Nationwide Holiday</FONT><BR><BR></P>
      <P align=left>The form that the observance and celebration of Labor Day 
      should take were outlined in the first proposal of the holiday — a street 
      parade to exhibit to the public "the strength and esprit de corps of the 
      trade and labor organizations" of the community, followed by a festival 
      for the recreation and amusement of the workers and their families. This 
      became the pattern for the celebrations of Labor Day. Speeches by 
      prominent men and women were introduced later, as more emphasis was placed 
      upon the economic and civic significance of the holiday. Still later, by a 
      resolution of the American Federation of Labor convention of 1909, the 
      Sunday preceding Labor Day was adopted as Labor Sunday and dedicated to 
      the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement. </P>
      <P align=left>The character of the Labor Day celebration has undergone a 
      change in recent years, especially in large industrial centers where mass 
      displays and huge parades have proved a problem. This change, however, is 
      more a shift in emphasis and medium of expression. Labor Day addresses by 
      leading union officials, industrialists, educators, clerics and government 
      officials are given wide coverage in newspapers, radio, and television. 
      </P>
      <P align=left>The vital force of labor added materially to the highest 
      standard of living and the greatest production the world has ever known 
      and has brought us closer to the realization of our traditional ideals of 
      economic and political democracy. It is appropriate, therefore, that the 
      nation pay tribute on Labor Day to the creator of so much of the nation's 
      strength, freedom, and leadership — the American worker. </P>
