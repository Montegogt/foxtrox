St. Patrick's Day is Ireland's greatest national holiday as well as a holy day.  The date marks the anniversary of the death of the missionary who became the patron saint of Ireland.  It is a happy holiday for the Irish wherever they may be - in Dublin, New York City, Boston, or San Francisco.  The day celebrated with parades, speeches, festive dinners, and dances.  Green is the color of the day, with thousands of little cloth shamrocks worn even by those whose forefathers never touched the shores of Ireland.
<P>
It is known that St. Patrick was born in Britain to wealthy parents near the end of the fourth century.   At the age of sixteen, Patrick was taken prisoner by a group of Irish raiders who were attacking his family's estate. They transported him to Ireland where he spent six years in captivity.   During this time, he worked as a shepherd, outdoors and away from people. Lonely and afraid, he turned to his religion for solace, becoming a devout Christian.  
<P>
The first St. Patrick's Day parade took place not in Ireland, but in the United States. Irish soldiers serving in the English military marched through New York City on March 17, 1762. Along with their music, the parade helped the soldiers to reconnect with their Irish roots, as well as fellow Irishmen serving in the English army.   Suddenly, annual St. Patrick's Day parades became a show of strength for Irish Americans, as well as a must-attend event for a slew of political candidates. In 1948, President Truman attended New York City 's St. Patrick's Day parade, a proud moment for the many Irish whose ancestors had to fight stereotypes and racial prejudice to find acceptance in America.

<P>Leprechauns are little make-believe fairies from Ireland. They are the little old men who are shoemakers for the fairies. They usually stand about 2 feet tall.  Treasure hunters can often track down a leprechaun by the sound of his shoemaker's hammer.  The legend is that if you catch one you can force him to tell you where he hides his gold.</font>

The Leprechaun</font><BR>
<font face="Georgia,Book Antiqua" size="3">By Robert Dwyer Joyce (1830-83)<BR>
<BR>
In a shady nook one moonlit night,<BR>
A leprahaun I spied<BR>
In scarlet coat and cap of green,<BR>
A cruiskeen by his side.<BR>
'Twas tick, tack, tick, his hammer went,<BR>
Upon a weeny shoe,<BR>
And I laughed to think of a purse of gold,<BR>
But the fairy was laughing too.<BR>
<BR>
With tip-toe step and beating heart,<BR>
Quite softly I drew night.<BR>
There was mischief in his merry face,<BR>
A twinkle in his eye;<BR>
He hammered and sang with tiny voice,<BR>
And sipped the mountain dew;<BR>
Oh! I laughed to think he was caught at last,<BR>
But the fairy was laughing, too.<BR>
<BR>
As quick as thought I grasped the elf,<BR>
"Your fairy purse," I cried,<BR>
"My purse?" said he, "'tis in her hand,<BR>
That lady by your side."<BR>
I turned to look, the elf was off,<BR>
And what was I to do?<BR>
Oh! I laughed to think what a fool I'd been,<BR>
And, the fairy was laughing too.<BR>

The leprechauns are laughing <BR>
For their day is finally here <BR>
The legends and the folklore <BR>
Seep through the atmosphere <BR>
The dancers are all ready <BR>
An Irish jig is in the air <BR>
The walls of the pubs are bursting <BR>
There is not an empty chair <BR>
As the night becomes the morning, <BR>
The barman leads the song <BR>
From Danny Boy to Irish Eyes <BR>
The serenade goes on. <BR>
Then a husky voice is heard to say<BR> 
Make this your final stein <BR>
For St. Patrick's day is over <BR>
At it's time Gentlemen it's time.<BR>

Blarney stone The Blarney Stone is a stone set in the wall of the Blarney Castle tower in the Irish village of Blarney. Kissing the stone is supposed to bring the kisser the gift of persuasive eloquence.  The legend says that an old woman cast a spell on the stone to reward a king who had saved her from drowning. Kissing the stone while under the spell gave the king the ability to speak sweetly and convincingly. It's difficult reach the stone.  Kissers have to lie on their back and bend backward or downward, holding iron bars for support.

<font face="Georgia,Book Antiqua" size="3">
<P>School children have started a little tradition of their own.  They pinch classmates who don't wear green on this holiday.  Wearing green is strictly a U.S. custom, as the color green is not popular in Ireland. Green is connected to the old green flag and a time when Ireland was not free.  Green is also a color connected with hope and nature. </font>

This verse, recited by a maiden as she gathered special herbs by the light of the first full moon of the new year, could reveal a future husband and cause the girl to have a true dream about the man--if she first complied with certain requirements.  With a black-handled knife she had to cut out three pieces of earth, bring them home, tie them in her left stocking, and secure the bundle with her right garter.  The completed package then had to be placed upon her pillow.

An Irishman who had a little to much to drink is driving home from the city one night and, of course, his car is weaving violently all over the road.  A cop pulls him over.<BR>
<BR>
"So," says the cop to the driver, "where have you been?"<BR>
<BR>
"Why, I've been to the pub of course" slurs the drunk.<BR>
<BR>
"Well," says the cop, "it looks like you've had quite a few to drink this evening".<BR>

<center>Irish Tradition</font></center>
<font face="Georgia,Book Antiqua" size="3">
<P>Many people will be eating Irish food such as Irish Stew and Corned Beef and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day.   Corned Beef is not an Irish dish.  It is what Americans think the Irish eat.  A more traditional meal would be ham and cabbage or bacon and cabbage.   Some say that in Ireland on St. Patrick's Day the traditional green beer is prominent.  However, in Ireland, many years ago, St. Patrick's Day is considered a holy day and Pubs were not open for business.  There were no parades, no drinking or wearing green.  Green was considered an unlucky color.</font>
