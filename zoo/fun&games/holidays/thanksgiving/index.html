Thanksgiving Day, legal holiday observed annually in the
United States on the fourth Thursday of November. In Canada, Thanksgiving falls
on the second Monday in October. Most people celebrate Thanksgiving by gathering
with family or friends for a holiday feast. Thanksgiving was first celebrated
by Pilgrims and Native Americans in colonial New England in the early 17th
century. Its actual origin, however, probably traces to harvest festivals that
have been traditional in many parts of the world since ancient times. Today
Thanksgiving is mainly a celebration of domestic life, centered on the home and
family.<br>

<font size=5 color=#CCFFCC><b>Customs and Symbols</b></font><br>
Public observances of Thanksgiving usually emphasize the holiday’s connection with the
Pilgrims. Thanksgiving pageants and parades often feature children dressed in
Pilgrim costume, complete with bonnets or tall hats, dark clothes, and shoes
with large silver-colored buckles.<br>
Many of the images commonly
associated with Thanksgiving are derived from much older traditions of
celebrating the autumn harvest. For example, the cornucopia (a horn-shaped
basket overflowing with fruits and vegetables) is a typical emblem of
Thanksgiving abundance that dates to ancient harvest festivals. Many
communities also decorate their churches with fruits, flowers, and vegetables
at Thanksgiving, much as European communities have for centuries during the
autumn harvest season.<br>
In keeping with
the idea of celebrating a plentiful harvest, preparing and eating a large meal
is a central part of most Thanksgiving celebrations. Thanksgiving menus usually
include turkey, bread-crumb stuffing, cranberry sauce, squash, mashed potatoes,
sweet potatoes, and pumpkin pie. These simple foods recall the rustic virtues
of the Pilgrims. Additionally, most of these foods are native to North America,
emphasizing the natural bounty that greeted early settlers in their adopted
homeland. Later groups of immigrants to North America often adapted the
traditional holiday menu to fit their own tastes. For example, many Italian
American Thanksgiving meals include Italian specialties, such as pasta and
wine.<br>
Many Americans digest their
holiday meal while watching football games on television. Traditionally, two
National Football League (NFL) teams, the Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys,
host games on Thanksgiving Day. High viewership of these holiday games has made
football an American Thanksgiving tradition.<br>

<font size=5 color=#CCFFCC><b>Origins</b></font><br>
Long before
Europeans settled in North America, western Europeans observed Harvest Home
festivals to celebrate the successful completion of gathering-in the season’s
crops. In the British Isles, Lammas Day (Loaf Mass Day), observed on August 1,
was often held to celebrate a good wheat harvest. If the wheat crop was
disappointing, the holiday was usually canceled.<br>
Another
important precursor to the modern Thanksgiving holiday was the custom among
English Puritans of designating special days of thanksgiving to express
gratitude for God’s blessings. These observances were not held regularly; they
usually took place only in times of crisis or immediately after a period of
misfortune had passed. Puritan thanksgiving ceremonies were serious religious
occasions and bore only a passing resemblance to modern Thanksgiving
celebrations.<br><br>
