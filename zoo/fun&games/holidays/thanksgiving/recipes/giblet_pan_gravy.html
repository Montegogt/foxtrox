The gravy is easily made in stages. Complete step 1 while the turkey is brining. Continue with step 2 once the bird is in the oven. Start step 3 once the bird has been removed from the oven and is resting on a carving board. If you prefer not to eat the giblets, you can discard them after you strain the broth at the end of step 1.

1. Heat oil in soup kettle; add giblets, neck, and tailpiece;  saut&#151; until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add onion; continue to saut&#151; until softened, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Reduce heat to low; cover and cook until turkey and onion release their juices, about 20 minutes. Add stock and herbs, bring to boil, then adjust heat to low. Simmer, skimming any scum that rises to surface, until broth is rich and flavorful, about 30 minutes longer. Strain broth (you should have about 5 cups), reserving neck, heart, and gizzard. When cool enough to handle, shred neck meat, remove gristle from  gizzard, then dice reserved heart and gizzard. Refrigerate  giblets and broth until ready to use.<p>

<b>2.</b> While turkey is roasting, return reserved turkey broth to simmer. Heat butter in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat.  Whisk in flour. Cook slowly, stirring constantly, until nutty brown and fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk in all but 1 cup of hot broth into roux. Bring to boil, then continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until gravy is lightly thickened and very flavorful, about 30 minutes longer. Set aside until turkey is done.<p>

<b>3.</b> After roasted turkey has been transferred to carving board to rest, spoon out and discard as much fat as possible from roasting pan, leaving caramelized herbs and vegetables. 
Return gravy in large saucepan to simmer.  Place roasting pan over two burners on medium-high heat.  Add wine to roasting pan with caramelized vegetables; scrape  up browned bits with wooden spoon and boil until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup broth, then strain  deglazed pan juices into gravy, pressing as much juice as possible out of  vegetables. Stir diced giblets and shredded meat into gravy; return to boil. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper. Serve with turkey.<p>
