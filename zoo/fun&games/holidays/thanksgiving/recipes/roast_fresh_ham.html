You can brine the ham 
in a large insulated cooler or a small plastic garbage can, if you don't have room in your refrigerator. Then add five or six freezer packs to the brine to keep it well cooled.

1. Following illustration below, carefully slice through skin and fat 
with serrated knife, making 1-inch diamond pattern. Be careful not to cut into meat.<br><br>

2. In large (about 16-quart) bucket or stockpot, dissolve salt and 
brown sugar in 1 gallon hot tap water. Add garlic, bay leaves, 
black pepper, and 1 gallon cold water. Submerge ham in brine and 
refrigerate 8 to 24 hours (or follow alternative directions at top).<br><br>

3. Set large disposable roasting pan on baking sheet for extra 
support; place flat wire rack in roasting pan. Remove ham from 
brine; rinse under cold water and dry thoroughly with paper 
towels. Place ham, wide cut-side down, on rack. (If using 
sirloin end, place ham skin-side up.) Let ham stand, uncovered, at room temperature 1 hour.<br><br>

4. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 
500 degrees. In workbowl of food processor fitted with steel blade, 
process sage, parsley, garlic, salt, pepper, and oil until mixture 
forms smooth paste, about 30 seconds. Rub all sides of ham with paste.<br><br>

5. Roast ham at 500 degrees for 20 minutes. Reduce oven 
temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast, brushing ham 
with glaze every 45 minutes, until center of ham registers 145 to 
150 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 2 1/2 hours longer. 
Tent ham loosely with foil and let stand until center of ham 
registers 155 to 160 degrees on thermometer, 30 to 40 minutes. 
Carve, and serve. <br><br>

<b>APPLE CIDER AND BROWN SUGAR GLAZE<br></b>

Makes about 1 1/3 cups, enough to glaze ham<br>

cup apple cider<br>

<br>


Bring cider, brown sugar, and cloves to boil in small nonreactive 
saucepan over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 
until syrupy and reduced to about 1 1/3 cups, 5 to 7 minutes. 
(Glaze will thicken as it cools between bastings; cook over 
medium heat about 1 minute, stirring once or twice, before using.)
