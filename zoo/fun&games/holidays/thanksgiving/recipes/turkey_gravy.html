To roast the trimmings and vegetables, it is best to use a roasting pan that can sit on the stovetop. 
If you do not own one, a broiler pan bottom will work; when setting it on the stovetop, however, 
use medium heat instead of high heat and add only half the amount of chicken broth before scraping up the 
drippings; add the other half of the chicken broth to the saucepan along with the wine.

1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Place turkey trimmings, carrot, celery, onions, 
and garlic in large flameproof roasting pan. Spray lightly with cooking spray and toss to combine. Roast, 
stirring every 10 minutes, until well-browned, 40 to 50 minutes.
<br>
<br>

2. Remove roasting pan from oven, and place over burner(s) set at high heat; add chicken stock and bring to boil, 
scraping up browned bits on bottom of pan with wooden spoon.
<br>
<br>

3. Transfer contents of roasting pan to large saucepan. Add wine, 3 cups water, and thyme; 
bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer until reduced by half, about 1 1/2 hours. 
Strain stock into large measuring cup or container. Cool to room temperature; 
cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until fat congeals, at least 1 hour.

<br>

4. To finish gravy, skim fat from stock using soup spoon; reserve fat. 
Pour stock through fine-mesh strainer to remove remaining bits of fat; discard bits in strainer. 
Bring stock to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. In second medium saucepan, 
heat 4 tablespoons reserved turkey fat over medium-high heat until bubbling; whisk in flour and cook, 
whisking constantly, until combined and honey-colored, about 2 minutes. Continuing to whisk constantly, 
gradually add hot stock; bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with turkey. 
(Can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; reheat in medium saucepan over medium heat until hot, about 8 minutes.)
