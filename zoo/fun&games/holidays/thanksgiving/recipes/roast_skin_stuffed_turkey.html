1. Follow recipe for <a href="roast_skin_turkey.html">Roast Crisp-Skin Turkey </a>through step 2.<p>
2. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Scatter vegetables and thyme in shallow roasting pan; pour 1 cup water over vegetables. <a href="../preparing_the_bird.html#4">Prepare V-rack following illustration 4.</a><p>
3. Place about 6 cups stuffing in medium microwave-safe bowl and cover with plastic wrap; microwave stuffing on high until stuffing registers 120 to 130 degrees on instant-read thermometer, about 6 minutes. Spoon hot stuffing into cavity of turkey; secure opening with turkey lacers or with skewers and kitchen twine. Tuck wings behind back. Brush breast with butter, then set turkey breast-side down on foil-lined V-rack; brush back with butter. Roast 1 hour, then reduce temperature to 250 degrees and roast 2 hours longer, adding more water to roasting pan if necessary. Meanwhile, place remaining stuffing in buttered 11- by 7-inch or 9-inch-square baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use.<p>
4. Remove roasting pan with turkey from oven; using thick wads of paper towels or pot holders, rotate turkey breast-side up and brush with remaining butter. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees; continue roasting until thickest part of breast registers about 165 degrees, thickest part of thigh registers 170 to 175 degrees, and stuffing registers 165 degrees on instant-read thermomete 1 to 1 1/2 hours longer. Remove turkey from oven and let rest until ready to carve.<p>
5. While turkey is resting, unwrap baking dish with stuffing and bake until golden brown, about 35 minutes.<p>
6. Carve turkey; serve with stuffing and gravy, if desired.
