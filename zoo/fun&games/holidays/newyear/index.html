      face=arial><B>"Happy New Year!" That greeting will be said and heard for 
      at least the first couple of weeks as a new year gets under way. But the 
      day celebrated as New Year's Day in modern America was not always January 
      1. 
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>ANCIENT NEW YEARS</FONT><BR>The celebration of the 
      new year is the oldest of all holidays. It was first observed in ancient 
      Babylon about 4000 years ago. In the years around 2000 BC, the Babylonian 
      New Year began with the first New Moon (actually the first visible 
      cresent) after the Vernal Equinox (first day of spring). 
      <P>The beginning of spring is a logical time to start a new year. After 
      all, it is the season of rebirth, of planting new crops, and of 
      blossoming. January 1, on the other hand, has no astronomical nor 
      agricultural significance. It is purely arbitrary. 
      <P>The Babylonian new year celebration lasted for eleven days. Each day 
      had its own particular mode of celebration, but it is safe to say that 
      modern New Year's Eve festivities pale in comparison. 
      <P><IMG src="nysnowman.gif" align=left> The Romans continued 
      to observe the new year in late March, but their calendar was continually 
      tampered with by various emperors so that the calendar soon became out of 
      synchronization with the sun. 
      <P>In order to set the calendar right, the Roman senate, in 153 BC, 
      declared January 1 to be the beginning of the new year. But tampering 
      continued until Julius Caesar, in 46 BC, established what has come to be 
      known as the Julian Calendar. It again established January 1 as the new 
      year. But in order to synchronize the calendar with the sun, Caesar had to 
      let the previous year drag on for 445 days. 
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>THE CHURCH'S VIEW OF NEW YEAR 
      CELEBRATIONS</FONT><BR>Although in the first centuries AD the Romans 
      continued celebrating the new year, the early Catholic Church condemned 
      the festivities as paganism. But as Christianity became more widespread, 
      the early church began having its own religious observances concurrently 
      with many of the pagan celebrations, and New Year's Day was no different. 
      New Years is still observed as the Feast of Christ's Circumcision by some 
      denominations. 
      <P>During the Middle Ages, the Church remained opposed to celebrating New 
      Years. January 1 has been celebrated as a holiday by Western nations for 
      only about the past 400 years. 
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>NEW YEAR TRADITIONS</FONT><BR><IMG 
      src="nyclock.gif" align=right> Other traditions of the 
      season include the making of New Year's resolutions. That tradition also 
      dates back to the early Babylonians. Popular modern resolutions might 
      include the promise to lose weight or quit smoking. The early Babylonian's 
      most popular resolution was to return borrowed farm equipment. 
      <P>The Tournament of Roses Parade dates back to 1886. In that year, 
      members of the Valley Hunt Club decorated their carriages with flowers. It 
      celebrated the ripening of the orange crop in California. 
      <P>Although the Rose Bowl football game was first played as a part of the 
      Tournament of Roses in 1902, it was replaced by Roman chariot races the 
      following year. In 1916, the football game returned as the sports 
      centerpiece of the festival. 
      <P><IMG src="nybaby.gif" align=left> The tradition of using 
      a baby to signify the new year was begun in Greece around 600 BC. It was 
      their tradition at that time to celebrate their god of wine, Dionysus, by 
      parading a baby in a basket, representing the annual rebirth of that god 
      as the spirit of fertility. Early Egyptians also used a baby as a symbol 
      of rebirth. 
      <P>Although the early Christians denounced the practice as pagan, the 
      popularity of the baby as a symbol of rebirth forced the Church to 
      reevaluate its position. The Church finally allowed its members to 
      celebrate the new year with a baby, which was to symbolize the birth of 
      the baby Jesus. 
      <P>The use of an image of a baby with a New Years banner as a symbolic 
      representation of the new year was brought to early America by the 
      Germans. They had used the effigy since the fourteenth century. 
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>FOR LUCK IN THE NEW YEAR</FONT><BR><IMG 
      src="nyfather.gif" align=right> Traditionally, it was 
      thought that one could affect the luck they would have throughout the 
      coming year by what they did or ate on the first day of the year. For that 
      reason, it has become common for folks to celebrate the first few minutes 
      of a brand new year in the company of family and friends. Parties often 
      last into the middle of the night after the ringing in of a new year. It 
      was once believed that the first visitor on New Year's Day would bring 
      either good luck or bad luck the rest of the year. It was particularly 
      lucky if that visitor happened to be a tall dark-haired man. 
      <P><IMG src="food.gif" align=left> Traditional New Year 
      foods are also thought to bring luck. Many cultures believe that anything 
      in the shape of a ring is good luck, because it symbolizes "coming full 
      circle," completing a year's cycle. For that reason, the Dutch believe 
      that eating donuts on New Year's Day will bring good fortune. 
      <P>Many parts of the U.S. celebrate the new year by consuming black-eyed 
      peas. These legumes are typically accompanied by either hog jowls or ham. 
      Black-eyed peas and other legumes have been considered good luck in many 
      cultures. The hog, and thus its meat, is considered lucky because it 
      symbolizes prosperity. Cabbage is another "good luck" vegetable that is 
      consumed on New Year's Day by many. Cabbage leaves are also considered a 
      sign of prosperity, being representative of paper currency. In some 
      regions, rice is a lucky food that is eaten on New Year's Day. 
      <P><FONT color=#ff0000>AULD LANG SYNE</FONT><BR>The song, "Auld Lang 
      Syne," playing in the background, is sung at the stroke of midnight in 
      almost every English-speaking country in the world to bring in the new 
      year. At least partially written by Robert Burns in the 1700's, it was 
      first published in 1796 after Burns' death. Early variations of the song 
      were sung prior to 1700 and inspired Burns to produce the modern 
      rendition. An old Scotch tune, "Auld Lang Syne" literally means "old long 
      ago," or simply, "the good old days." The lyrics can be found <A
