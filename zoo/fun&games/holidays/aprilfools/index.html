<P>Unlike most of the other nonfoolish holidays, the history of April Fool's 
Day, sometimes called All Fool's Day, is not totally clear. There really wasn't 
a "first April Fool's Day" that can be pinpointed on the calendar. Some believe 
it sort of evolved simultaneously in several cultures at the same time, from 
celebrations involving the first day of spring. 
<P>The closest point in time that can be identified as the beginning of this 
tradition was in 1582, in France. Prior to that year, the new year was 
celebrated for eight days, beginning on March 25. The celebration culminated on 
April 1. With the reform of the calendar under Charles IX, the Gregorian 
Calendar was introduced, and New Year's Day was moved to January 1. 
<P>However, communications being what they were in the days when news traveled 
by foot, many people did not receive the news for several years. Others, the 
more obstinate crowd, refused to accept the new calendar and continued to 
celebrate the new year on April 1. These backward folk were labeled as "fools" 
by the general populace. They were subject to some ridicule, and were often sent 
on "fools errands" or were made the butt of other practical jokes. 
<P>This harassment evolved, over time, into a tradition of prank-playing on the 
first day of April. The tradition eventually spread to England and Scotland in 
the eighteenth century. It was later introduced to the American colonies of both 
the English and French. April Fool's Day thus developed into an international 
fun fest, so to speak, with different nationalities specializing in their own 
brand of humor at the expense of their friends and families. 
<P>In Scotland, for example, April Fool's Day is actually celebrated for two 
days. The second day is devoted to pranks involving the posterior region of the 
body. It is called Taily Day. The origin of the "kick me" sign can be traced to 
this observance. 
<P>Mexico's counterpart of April Fool's Day is actually observed on December 28. 
Originally, the day was a sad remembrance of the slaughter of the innocent 
children by King Herod. It eventually evolved into a lighter commemoration 
involving pranks and trickery. 
<P>Pranks performed on April Fool's Day range from the simple, (such as saying, 
"Your shoe's untied!), to the elaborate. Setting a roommate's alarm clock back 
an hour is a common gag. Whatever the prank, the trickster usually ends it by 
yelling to his victim, "April Fool!" 
<P>Practical jokes are a common practice on April Fool's Day. Sometimes, 
elaborate practical jokes are played on friends or relatives that last the 
entire day. The news media even gets involved. For instance, a British short 
film once shown on April Fool's Day was a fairly detailed documentary about 
"spaghetti farmers" and how they harvest their crop from the spaghetti trees. 
<P>April Fool's Day is a "for-fun-only" observance. Nobody is expected to buy 
gifts or to take their "significant other" out to eat in a fancy restaurant. 
Nobody gets off work or school. It's simply a fun little holiday, but a holiday 
on which one must remain forever vigilant, for he may be the next April 
Fool!</FONT>
