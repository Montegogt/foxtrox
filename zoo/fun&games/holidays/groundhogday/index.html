<H3>How Did the Groundhog Get a Day of His Own?</H3><IMG alt=Groundhog 
src="groundhog.jpg" align=right> 
<P>The lowly groundhog, often called a woodchuck, is the only mammal to have a 
day named in his honor. The groundhog's day is February 2. Granted, it’s not a 
federal holiday; nobody gets off work. But still, to have a day named after you 
is quite a feat. 
<P>How did the groundhog come by this honor? 
<P>It stems from the ancient belief that hibernating creatures were able to 
predict the arrival of springtime by their emergence. 
<P>The German immigrants known as Pennsylvania Dutch brought the tradition to 
America in the 18th century. They had once regarded the badger as the 
winter-spring barometer. But the job was reassigned to the groundhog after 
importing their Candlemas traditions to the U.S. Candlemas commemorates the 
ritual purification of Mary, 40 days after the birth of Jesus. 
<P>Candlemas is one of the four "cross-quarters" of the year, occurring half way 
between the first day of winter and the first day of spring. Traditionally, it 
was believed that if Candlemas was sunny, the remaining six weeks of winter 
would be stormy and cold. But if it rained or snowed on Candlemas, the rest of 
the winter would be mild. If an animal "sees its shadow," it must be sunny, so 
more wintry weather is predicted: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If Candlemas be fair and bright,<BR>Winter has another flight.<BR>If 
  Candlemas brings clouds and rain,<BR>Winter will not come again. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The groundhog and badger were not the only animals that have been used to 
predict spring. Other Europeans used the bear or hedgehog--but in any case the 
honor belonged to a creature that hibernated. Its emergence symbolized the 
imminent arrival of spring. 
<P>Traditionally, the groundhog is supposed to awaken on February 2, Groundhog 
Day, and come up out of his burrow. If he sees his shadow, he will return to the 
burrow for six more weeks of winter. If he doesn’t see his shadow, he remains 
outside and starts his year, because he knows that spring has arrived early. 
<P>In the U.S., the “official” groundhog is kept in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Every February 2, amid a raucous celebration early in the morning, “Punxsutawney 
Phil” as the groundhog is called, is pulled from his den by his keepers, who are 
dressed in tuxedos. Phil then whispers his weather prediction into the ear of 
his keeper, who then announces it to the anxiously-awaiting crowd. 
<P>Of course, this is for show. It’s a fun celebration and a great tradition. 
But Phil's keepers secretly decide upon the "forecast" in advance of the 
groundhog's arousal. 
<P>Besides, spring always arrives on or near March 21, so whether the groundhog 
decides to return to his den or remain above ground, the sad fact is spring will 
always have to wait at least six more weeks.
