      Dodd, of Washington, first had the idea of a "father's day." She thought 
      of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon in 
      1909. 
      <P><FONT color=red size=+2>S</FONT>onora wanted a special day to honor her 
      father, William Smart. Smart, who was a Civil War veteran, was widowed 
      when his wife died while giving birth to their sixth child. Mr. Smart was 
      left to raise the newborn and his other five children by himself on a 
      rural farm in eastern Washington state. 
      <P><FONT color=red size=+2>A</FONT>fter Sonora became an adult she 
      realized the selflessness her father had shown in raising his children as 
      a single parent. It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices 
      and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a courageous, selfless, and loving 
      man. Sonora's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first 
      Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910. 

      <P><FONT color=red size=+2>P</FONT>resident Calvin Coolidge, in 1924, 
      supported the idea of a national Father's Day. Then in 1966 President 
      Lyndon Johnson signed a presidential proclamation declaring the 3rd Sunday 
      of June as Father's Day.</FONT>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><IMG src="worlddad.gif" align=right> "A 
        father is always making his baby into a little woman. And when she is a 
        woman he turns her back again." -- <I>Enid Bagnold</I> 
        <P>"It no longer bothers me that I may be constantly searching for 
        father figures; by this time, I have found several and dearly enjoyed 
        knowing them all." -- <I>Alice Walker</I> 
        <P>"None of you can ever be proud enough of being the child of SUCH a 
        Father who has not his equal in this world-so great, so good, so 
        faultless. Try, all of you, to follow in his footsteps and don't be 
        discouraged, for to be really in everything like him none of you, I am 
        sure, will ever be. Try, therefore, to be like him in some points, and 
        you will have acquired a great deal." -- <I>Victoria, Queen of 
        England</I> 
        <P>"That is the thankless position of the father in the family-the 
        provider for all, and the enemy of all." -- <I>J. August Strindberg</I> 
        <P>"It is a wise father that knows his own child." -- <I>William 
        Shakespeare</I> 
        <P>"It doesn't matter who my father was; it matters who I remember he 
        was." -- <I>Anne Sexton</I> 
        <P>"One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters." -- <I>English 
        Proverb</I> 
        <P>"To be a successful father . . . there's one absolute rule: when you 
        have a kid, don't look at it for the first two years." -- <I>Ernest 
        Hemingway</I> 
        <P>"A man knows when he is growing old because he begins to look like 
        his father." -- <I>Gabriel García Márquez</I> 
        <P>"I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as the need for a 
        father's protection." -- <I>Sigmund Freud</I> 
        <P>"I watched a small man with thick calluses on both hands work fifteen 
        and sixteen hours a day. I saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms 
        of his feet, a man who came here uneducated, alone, unable to speak the 
        language, who taught me all I needed to know about faith and hard work 
        by the simple eloquence of his example." -- <I>Mario Cuomo</I> 
        <P>"Be kind to thy father, for when thou wert young,<BR>Who loved thee 
        so fondly as he?<BR>He caught the first accents that fell from thy 
        tongue,<BR>And joined in thy innocent glee."<BR>-- <I>Margaret 
        Courtney</I> 
        <P>"If the new American father feels bewildered and even defeated, let 
        him take comfort from the fact that whatever he does in any fathering 
        situation has a fifty percent chance of being right." -- <I>Bill 
        Cosby</I> 
        <P>"Blessed indeed is the man who hears many gentle voices call him 
        father!" -- <I>Lydia M. Child</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>
