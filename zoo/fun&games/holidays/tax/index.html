<b>taxes</b>
   first mentioned in the command (Ex. 30:11-16) that every Jew
   from twenty years and upward should pay an annual tax of "half a
   shekel for an offering to the Lord." This enactment was
   faithfully observed for many generations (2 Chr. 24:6; Matt.
   17:24).   
     Afterwards, when the people had kings to reign over them, they
   began, as Samuel had warned them (1 Sam. 8:10-18), to pay taxes
   for civil purposes (1 Kings 4:7; 9:15; 12:4). Such taxes, in
   increased amount, were afterwards paid to the foreign princes
   that ruled over them.   
     In the New Testament the payment of taxes, imposed by lawful
   rulers, is enjoined as a duty (Rom. 13:1-7; 1 Pet. 2:13, 14).
   Mention is made of the tax (telos) on merchandise and travellers
   (Matt. 17:25); the annual tax (phoros) on property (Luke 20:22;
   23:2); the poll-tax (kensos, "tribute," Matt. 17:25; 22:17; Mark
   12:14); and the temple-tax ("tribute money" = two drachmas =
   half shekel, Matt. 17:24-27; comp. Ex. 30:13). (See <a href="/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=TRIBUTE">TRIBUTE</a>.)

      <DIV align=justify>It&#8217;s that time of year again, when headache-relief and 
      antacid consumption increases, when H &amp; R Block ads air with annoying 
      frequency, and the talk around the office water cooler turns to refunds 
      and payments interspersed with the <I>de rigueur </I>grumbling about 
      taxes.<I> </I>Most Americans seem to get a perverse pleasure out of 
      complaining about the income tax and the IRS, and rightly so&#8212;the income 
      tax is the most visible manifestation of the government&#8217;s money grab, and 
      the IRS has earned its reputation for brutality and vindictiveness. Even 
      most individuals who believe the myth that government must provide certain 
      services will grant that the IRS regularly exceeds its bounds. So, the 
      focus that gets placed on "tax day" is understandable. However, there are 
      problems associated with this seasonal focus on taxes.</DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>One problem is that the annual ritual of bitching about taxes has 
      become just that&#8212;a ritual for most Americans, one that inspires almost the 
      same amount of critical thinking as the phrase "have a nice day". A 
      corollary problem concerns the time frame of this ritual. Just like 
      Christmas or Halloween decorations, the receipts, forms, and tax 
      advertisements are trotted out, and after April 15 attention to the tax 
      issue fades as baseball season or lawn care or some other ritual looms on 
      the horizon. This pattern blurs the impact of the federal income tax 
      because it encourages citizens to focus on whatever happens in April, 
      rather than the regular theft of their earnings over the year.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>A more serious problem with the annual income tax-bashing ritual is 
      that it focuses on only one aspect of the tax monster that daily ravages 
      every individual living in the United States. The federal income tax and 
      the IRS thugs who enforce it are certainly deserving of attention and 
      scorn, but that tax is only one of many taxes we are burdened with. 
      Depending upon where an individual lives and the laws in effect there, 
      other taxes can include: social security; Medicare; customs duties; 
      excise; luxury; state income; state sales; local income; local sales; 
      estate; inheritance; gasoline; "sin" (taxes on cigarettes and alcohol); 
      property; capital gains; interest income; gift; utilities (telephone in 
      particular); beverage container (aluminum and/or glass); hotel occupancy; 
      and tax increases resulting from bonds floated to support things such as 
      schools, infrastructure maintenance and improvement (sewage and other 
      waste disposal, street repair and lighting, etc.), and a variety of social 
      programs. These are taxes that each consumer pays directly. There are more 
      taxes that individuals bear the costs of, being passed along to us in the 
      form of increased prices for goods and services: regulatory taxes on 
      industries such as trucking, farming, banking, and flying; import taxes; 
      and a range of corporate taxes. I am sure that in my research I have 
      missed a tax or two as well.</P></DIV>
      <CENTER>
      <P><B>Adding Up the Costs</B></P></CENTER>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>How do all these taxes add up? Besides the obvious response of 
      "quickly!", various means have been devised for expressing the scope of a 
      typical American&#8217;s tax burden. The Tax Foundation (<A 
      href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/" 
      onclick="CSAction(new Array('B3367B7C6'));return CSClickReturn();" 
      csclick="B3367B7C6">http://www.taxfoundation.org/</A>), a non-profit, 
      non-partisan organization devoted to studying tax issues, offers a variety 
      of informative measures. The first is "Tax Freedom Day"&#8212;the day on which 
      the typical American has worked enough to pay her share of federal, state, 
      and local taxes for a year, and the rest of her income goes in her pocket. 
      <B>In 1998, Tax Freedom Day was May 10&#8212;in other words, the typical 
      American worked 130 days to pay taxes.</B> Another way to look at tax 
      costs is to calculate the number of hours per eight-hour workday that the 
      average American spends working to pay taxes. By this measure, an American 
      spends almost 3 hours each workday paying taxes. That&#8217;s longer than the 
      time needed to pay for household-related items (including housing itself), 
      food, and clothing combined.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Another group, Americans for Tax Reform (<A href="http://www.atr.org/" 
      onclick="CSAction(new Array('B3367BB47'));return CSClickReturn();" 
      csclick="B3367BB47">http://www.atr.org/</A>), calculates the "Cost of 
      Government Day", which includes all taxes as well as other costs of 
      government that individuals ultimately bear, including federal regulatory 
      costs (e.g., EPA mandates, affirmative action compliance, laws that 
      increase business costs, etc.). Including these costs, in 1998 a typical 
      American worked to pay for the government&#8217;s activities (federal, state, 
      and local) until June 25&#8212;almost half the year.</P></DIV>
      <CENTER>
      <P><B>Paying, and Paying, and Paying&#8230;</B></P></CENTER>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Looked at in this light, it should be obvious that our tax situation is 
      completely out of control. How did things get so bad? Most of the creeping 
      encroachment of taxes into a person&#8217;s income is done in ways that are 
      hidden, so we don&#8217;t see the direct effect of many tax increases. A 
      paycheck has certain federal, state, and local deductions taken 
      automatically&#8212;the payee never gets the entire amount earned. Those 
      deductions are listed, and people grumble about how much Uncle Sam takes 
      out, <B>but do you think most people would only grumble if they received 
      their full salary in one line, then had to step over to another line to 
      pay all those taxes?</B> Similarly, taxes on things like gasoline, 
      cigarettes, and liquor are added in to the retail price, so unless one 
      knows how much the tax is on these items, it&#8217;s almost impossible to 
      separate that price into tax and product cost. Even a tax resistor&#8212;who 
      doesn&#8217;t pay the government&#8217;s extortion thugs, and tries to operate outside 
      the economy as much as possible&#8212;pays many taxes, either directly or 
      indirectly.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Some might think I am being unnecessarily harsh&#8212;after all, we can get 
      income tax refunds, which lessens the load. Yeah, right. The refund that a 
      person <I>might</I> get from his federal and state income taxes paid all 
      year is only a portion of the total tax collected, and most of those taxes 
      he will never see again&#8212;never get refunded, nor will he benefit directly 
      from them.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>What about all the politicians who say they&#8217;re for tax reform? Get 
      real. The Americans for Tax Reform sponsors a "Taxpayer Protection 
      Pledge," which is a written pledge that state and federal legislators can 
      sign to show their commitment to oppose efforts to increase taxes. 
      According to their web site, about 250 congresspeople have signed the 
      pledge. How lovely. So we&#8217;ve nothing to fear, right? Wrong. Virtually all 
      the bills that come before Congress have some kind of spending proposal in 
      them, and these bills are so long and complex that it&#8217;s impossible for a 
      legislator to read and understand each one before the vote is taken. That 
      pledge is one more promise made today, forgotten tomorrow.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>All the money government steals is money that someone else worked for, 
      and which that individual won&#8217;t get to use, to improve his life, or for 
      whatever he wants to do with it. That&#8217;s "opportunity cost," and it 
      compounds just like interest, except in this case it&#8217;s a corrosive cost on 
      the quality of life. Government&#8217;s power comes from its power to tax, and 
      the more it taxes, the less economic freedom there is.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>While you&#8217;re griping with the rest this month, instead of putting away 
      the tax topic after April 15, bring it up again on May 10&#8212;Tax Freedom Day. 
      And don&#8217;t forget June 25&#8212;Cost of Government Day. It&#8217;s okay if you are a 
      little late celebrating these momentous days; chances are good that the 
      tax bite has increased, and the dates are pushed back even further this 
      year. If you vote, election day is a good day to bring up the issue&#8230; Hell, 
      in America, <I>every</I> day is tax day.</P></DIV>

<H1>The "Soak the Rich" Tax Scam</H1>
<H3><I>by Don Lobo Tiggre</I></H3>
<P>
<TABLE border=0 width="500">
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>
      <DIV align=justify>Each year, in the Infernal Revenue Service instruction 
      booklets for the various evil incarnations of Form 1040, there is a set of 
      pie charts. </DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The first of this year&#8217;s charts looks like a chipped 1960s peace 
      symbol; it is a graphical representation of the federal government&#8217;s 
      income. </P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The second chart looks more like a broken dinner plate; it represents 
      federal outlays (spending). These simple charts tell some very interesting 
      stories about where the United States federal government&#8217;s money comes 
      from and how it is used&#8212;they are a sort of balance sheet for the 
      nation.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>A concerned taxpayer might look at these charts and notice that the 
      largest slice of the income pie is labeled &#8216;personal income&#8217;: 46 percent! 
      The weary taxpayer might then notice that &#8216;corporate income taxes&#8217; only 
      amount to 11 percent. Not only that, but the &#8216;social security, Medicare, 
      and unemployment and other retirement taxes&#8217; slice&#8212;the part taken out of 
      every paycheck with no way to stop it, reduce it, or get a refund&#8212;is 
      another 34 percent. This means that individual taxpayers are supporting 
      <B>80 percent</B> of the immediate cash cost of the federal 
      government.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>In this light, it is all too easy to understand why so many taxpayers 
      and voters seem to fall for the &#8216;soak the rich&#8217; rhetoric of politicians 
      who win support by promising more government programs (spending) at the 
      expense of those nasty corporations. Why, those greedy rich corporations 
      are only paying 11 percent, and they have a greater obligation to support 
      the needy!</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Or so the ploy goes. This rhetoric ignores the fact that many single 
      proprietor businesses, family businesses, and small partnerships are 
      corporations. It also ignores the fact that the owners of corporations 
      have their earnings reduced by corporate income taxes, and then pay the 
      same income tax&#8212;or more, if they really are rich&#8212;as everyone else. Another 
      inconvenient fact ignored is that most of the owners of large corporations 
      are not Armani-clad Wall Street types&#8212;there are only so many of them&#8212;but 
      middle aged people and senior citizens. Now, it may be that the Armani 
      class controls the corporations, but they don&#8217;t own them all. It&#8217;s the 
      collection of "little old ladies next door" and "guys down the street" who 
      either own stocks directly, or have a lot of their savings tied up in 
      mutual funds that own stock in corporations. And the most important thing 
      this rhetoric ignores is that any tax levied on a corporation is just 
      another business expense to be passed along to customers, as far as 
      corporations are concerned.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>And who do you think pays those estate, gift, and miscellaneous taxes? 
      (One hint: it&#8217;s not the Easter Bunny!)</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>So, yes, it may seem "unfair" that personal income taxes are 
      shouldering ten percent more of the tax load than they were five years ago 
      (they went from 36 percent to 46 percent of federal revenue), while the 
      burden has only increased from 8 percent to 11 percent for corporations. 
      But this is only at first glance. The thing to remember is that 
      corporations don&#8217;t really exist. They are legal fictions. What exists are 
      people, individual people, and they are shouldering <B>100 percent</B> of 
      the burden, whether that be through corporate taxes passed on to 
      consumers, personal income taxes, retirement taxes, or any other form of 
      legalized theft you care to name. The only exception is the portion 
      shifted to our children via deficit spending, and even then it&#8217;s still 
      individual people who pay <FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> they just do it in 
      the future. The deficit, by the way, has gone from 18 percent to 1 percent 
      in the last five years, which is why all the other income pie segments 
      have gotten larger.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Okay, so forget about corporations, those darned rich people need to 
      help out more&#8212;from each according to his ability, to each according to his 
      need. Never mind that the top 50 percent of America&#8217;s wealth creators pay 
      more than 95 percent of all income taxes. Yes, never mind the facts, think 
      of the poor!</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The poor?</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The unusually conscientious taxpayer might then look at the spending 
      pie to see how &#8216;the poor&#8217; are being helped. &#8216;Social programs&#8217;&#8212;none of 
      which are authorized by the Constitution&#8212;only comprise 18 percent of 
      federal spending. That is almost as much as the 
      constitutionally-authorized amount spent on national defense (including 
      spending on veterans and foreign affairs: 20 percent). However, neither of 
      these come close to the whopping 38 percent spent on social security, 
      Medicare, and other retirement programs <I><B>that are not 
      means-tested</B></I>.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>So, while it is arguable whether or not social programs actually help 
      &#8216;the poor,&#8217; it is clear that the largest portion of the money extracted 
      from &#8216;the rich&#8217; is going to older citizens, many of whom are by no means 
      poor.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Now, remember that the ownership of corporate America lies only in 
      small part in the hands of wealthy tycoons; a far greater portion lies in 
      the hands of our parents and grandparents. Bill Gates, the richest man in 
      the world, has only a fraction of the net value of many of the pension and 
      mutual funds that rule today&#8217;s Wall Street. Most of the investors in these 
      funds are older Americans who&#8217;ve pulled large amounts of money out of 
      savings accounts because of the record low interest rates banks are 
      paying. In other words, the people who are the recipients of the largest 
      portion of federal spending are the people who own most of the stock of 
      large corporations&#8212;the very people crusading politicians claim to be 
      soaking.</P></DIV>

      <P><B>In fiscal 1997, the federal government took in $539 billion in 
      non-refundable taxes dedicated to retirement and unemployment benefits. 
      This came mostly from people between the ages of 18 and 65. In the same 
      time period, the federal government spent $632 billion on those same 
      benefits. This went mostly to people who are over 65 and are not poverty 
      stricken.</B></P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Is this taxing the rich to help the poor?</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Looking at the outlay pie again, we see that $244 billion&#8212;15 
      percent!&#8212;did not go to any programs at all, but was spent on interest. Now 
      the deficit is almost under control, for the <I>time being</I>, but the US 
      government is more like a reckless spender who has charged up his credit 
      cards and can&#8217;t make any new charges than a person in sound financial 
      shape. Such mismanagement suggests that &#8216;soaking the rich&#8217; in order to 
      give them retirement benefits is, at the very least, inefficient. The 
      words "criminally insane" also come to mind.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P><B>That reality, as unpleasant as it may be, must be faced; what we 
      have is a coercive inter-generational siphoning of money that has nothing 
      to do with "social justice"</B> (not that there really is such a thing). 
      The self-defeating policies begun with the New Deal and accelerated during 
      the Great Society debacle are hitting home with a vengeance. <B>America&#8217;s 
      producers are being sacrificed to America&#8217;s former producers</B>, at a 
      rate of $0.63 trillion a year and climbing.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Even those who have the greatest incentive to maintain this untenable 
      status quo, the politicians who depend on senior citizen votes, know that 
      this situation simply can <I>not</I> be maintained. Notice the glee with 
      which the president recently announced that Social Insecurity and 
      Mediscare will last a few years longer than previously estimated before 
      defaulting on their obligations&#8212;as though that would make any difference! 
      Pumping money in giant circles through the horrendously leaky mechanism of 
      government will soon leave us all sucked dry. This is so obvious that even 
      the last true believers in President Johnson&#8217;s Great Society have been 
      forced to read the writing on the wall and are (once <I>again</I>) talking 
      about reforming Social Security and Medicare.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Should the will of these reformers weaken, the American people will 
      remind them (at the voting booth) to do the right thing. The people know 
      the score: they see the break in the pavement looming in the headlights 
      (<I>don&#8217;t they?</I>). The government should be gotten out of (mis)managing 
      retirement. This willingness to even think about taking the federal 
      government&#8217;s fattest sacred cows to the block is a major step forward, of 
      course, but is it too little, too late?</P></DIV>

      <DIV align=justify>You've heard it said that the only sure things in life 
      are death and taxes. And for most adults, it's a fact. One of the greatest 
      rites of youthful passage only occurs after 16 years of school and a third 
      of a lifetime of preparation. You've finally landed a decent paying job 
      and worked out just how you're going to spend the first check. With 
      excited hands you tear it open, only to suffer the shock of finding more 
      than a third of it <I>"withheld."</I></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>Few people forget that shock. And few things are more amusing than 
      watching the expression on the face of someone undergoing this memorable 
      moment. After working to climb out of the well of poverty, who isn't 
      surprised and dismayed to find that the taxing authorities now include 
      <I>you</I> among the "<I>rich</I>?" Who isn't stunned when realizing that 
      for the first five months of any given year you belong to them as virtual 
      chattel? You can choose your yoke. You can choose your labor and keep some 
      of the reward, or choose not to labor and become a poor but bound 
      dependent of the state. You can even choose where you live and make your 
      effort. But you can't easily choose to earn and produce and not to belong 
      to your feudal masters, if only by the percentage. And if you think these 
      assertions are exaggerations, you are entitled to your opinion. But even 
      if you're educated and well informed, you might consider the possibility 
      that you have limited your perspective of reality. A husband is often the 
      last to know about a cheating wife.</P></DIV>

      family concerns, and from our interest in Kosovo, Clinton, China, to pay 
      attention to another demand. If we've put forth any effort in the past 
      year, if we've earned any money at all, most of us must calculate the 
      share demanded by the Internal Revenue Service. And the battle between 
      those who work, who produce, who earn, and those socially situated both 
      above and below them who would claim a percentage of their efforts, is 
      nothing new.</P></DIV>

      <P>While there's a postmodern movement to portray ancient Egypt as an

      direct taxation. Some scholars claim that there was not even a word for

      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>On the other hand, Ancient Democratic Greece and Republican Rome placed 
      a very strong value on the concept of liberty. At least during their 
      formative years where such concepts were held in high spiritual esteem. So 
      did the ancient Israelites, whose escape from Pharaonic domination in 
      Exodus is still celebrated in households around the world nearly three and 
      a half millennia later. Precisely like America, Rome coined gold and 
      silver with the goddess of liberty as a principal image. And precisely 
      like America, classical Roman coinage was progressively debased until the 
      silver denarius -- equal to a day's pay for the Roman foot soldier and a 
      symbolic standard of the nation -- became nothing more than a copper 
      planchet coated with a thin silver plating. Emperors pilfered off the 
      silver, typically without notifying the public of the lowered standard. 
      That the denarius, or <I>"denny,"</I> in its debased copper form is still 
      with us today as the "penny," should be a reminder that we are still 
      subject to the same human forces that plagued the ancient world. For those 
      of you who are old enough to remember the reference to our own pocket 
      change as <I>"silver,"</I> you don't have to look any further than our own 
      nickel-plated tokens to get a picture of why the so-called <I>"hidden tax 
      of inflation"</I> is associated with currency debasement. </P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The resulting fiscal chaos caused Roman rulers to become progressively 
      oppressive in making up the difference to the depreciating national 
      currency through increased overt taxation. Classical authors from the 
      ancient Mediterranean remind us that the scourge and the rack and were 
      used against negligent taxpayers. Fathers were compelled to prostitute 
      their daughters. Children were sold into slavery. Roman citizens began to 
      flee the nation to avoid taxation and repression. Diocletian imposed price 
      controls and harsh punishment in attempt to preserve the faltering 
      standards of weights and measures, and thereby the interests of late Roman 
      Imperial rulers. The consequence for trying to escape currency debasement 
      finally became death. Penalties are presently increasing for trying the 
      same in modern America, as they did in National Socialist Germany and 
      Communist Russia. So believe it or not, Stalin, Hitler, and even Bill 
      Clinton had their role models.</P></DIV>

      <P><B>Early American Money and Taxation</B></P></CENTER>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>But as many of the American Founders were fluent in Greek, Latin, and a 
      few even in Hebrew, they knew about this history. Contrast George 
      Washington with Diocletian. Washington donated his family dinner silver to 
      establish the beginning of a silver coinage by the U.S. Treasury. After 
      the Shay rebellion in 1786, which at least in part occurred in protest to 
      taxation, pressure grew that led to the Constitutional Convention. And the 
      issue of central power and taxation was a primary controversy among those 
      that attended. You no doubt all remember the <A 
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0899666957/laissezfairecity/"><I>Federalist 
      Papers</I>.</A> In The <A 
      href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870234196/laissezfairecity/"><I>Making 
      of an Agrarian Insurrection</I>,</A> David Szatmary contended that the 
      Shay uprising was a manifestation of a cultural split between those 
      committed to commercialism and individualism on the one side, and those 
      which held to the feudal traditions on the other. Henry Knox misled 
      Washington when he wrote that the two or three thousand Shays numbered 
      <I>fifteen</I> thousand, intending to march on Boston to loot the Bank of 
      Massachusetts. Apparently attracted to the American monarchy movement, 
      Knox also wrote to Washington that "three sevenths" of the population of 
      Massachusetts favored a parliamentary national government "analogous to 
      the British Constitution." The battle lines drawn during the revolutionary 
      war were alive and well, and in spite of the view of present day 
      revisionists and their penchant for federal domination, the Shays may have 
      been the first post revolutionary American "patriots." But the framers 
      fought this out, and fortunately for most living in America, those 
      opposing monarchy and feudalism insisted on instituting a federal 
      government with practical limitations.</P></DIV>

      Ordo Seclorum: the intellectual origins of the U.S. Constitution</I>,</A> 
      Forrest McDonald wrote that, "&#8230;the Framers brought a vast knowledge of 
      history&#8230;with them to Philadelphia in May of 1787, and that they departed 
      four months later having fashioned a frame of government that necessitated 
      a redefinition of most of the terms in which the theory and ideology of 
      civic humanism had been discussed. Into the bargain, they introduced an 
      entirely new concept to the discourse, that of federalism, and in the 
      doing, created a <I>novus ordo seclorum</I>: a new order of the ages." 
      </P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>But the schism between those that would insist on individual liberty as 
      the primary spiritual basis of the culture, and those that would follow 
      the ancient Pharaonic model, has not yet been fully resolved. All you have 
      to do is pull out a Federal Reserve one-dollar note and check out the

      <P>The form of taxation history reveals as most burdensome, the form we 
      live under today, is the <I><B>"direct tax."</B></I> Direct taxes are 
      imposed on personal property, including money and compensation for labor. 
      That clearly includes income tax. <I><B>Indirect taxes</B></I>, by 
      contrast, are excises, duties, and imports. All original U.S. taxes were 
      indirect taxes, mostly on distilled spirits. Remember the Whiskey 
      Rebellion of 1794 and the Revenuers? Those taxes were eventually expanded 
      to include tobacco, sugar, and federal legal instruments such as U.S. 
      bonds. They were repealed in 1802, and for a period of ten years there 
      were no federal taxes. From 1813 to 1817 indirect taxation was implemented 
      again to pay for the War of 1812. Then for the next 43 years there were no 
      internal federal taxes. </P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The Framers rejected direct taxation unless they were apportioned to 
      each state according to population. But an income tax was levied during 
      the Civil War and upheld by the Supreme Court. In 1862 under the <I>Bureau 
      of Internal Revenue</I>, Lincoln implemented a graduated 3 percent to 10 
      percent tax on income for certain government employees earning over $800 
      per year. But it was discontinued shortly after the war. <B>When another 
      attempt was made to impose taxes on income in 1893, the Supreme Court 
      ruled it unconstitutional. </B>In 1895, the Court declared that it

      <P>Finally, in 1909, the 16<SUP>th</SUP> Amendment was proposed. And if 
      you like, you can ask Red Beckman how he feels about that one. The IRS 
      bulldozed his house to the ground after they seized it and he refused to 
      surrender it to them. They may not have confiscated much of a remaining 
      asset, but, by God, in their eyes it was <I>their</I> asset and they meant 
      to have it. Of course, the fact that Beckman co-authored a book detailing 
      a duplicitous ratification of the 16th Amendment may not have helped him 
      much. </P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>The 16th Amendment was passed on July 2, 1909, but official 
      ratification didn't occur until 1913. According to Beckman and author Bill 
      Benson in their book, <I>The Law That Never Was</I>, there is no official 
      record of legitimate ratification in the National Archives. They traveled 
      to all the lower 48 states to follow up, and claim that the state records 
      are in conflict with the official federal position on the 16<SUP>th</SUP>. 
      Their contention has sparked a heated controversy between those that claim 
      to know the truth, and those that insist such assertions can be nothing 
      but absurd. Typically, the latter group has something invested in 
      preserving the federal status quo. Evidence is acknowledged that the votes 
      for and against from Kentucky, for example, were switched by then 
      Secretary of State Philander Knox. But whether the entire contention of 
      Beckman and Benson is true or not, recent events compel rational thinkers 
      to treat the assertions and actions of centralized power with

      that issue depends on where you stand. If you're a federal judge, a 
      bureaucrat, or a federal apologist, you're much more likely to side with 
      the interpretation that the federal government has the authority to tax 
      income. Your power, your position, your very livelihood depends on it. By 
      reason of logical interest, you are going to be inclined to construe the

      physically swarm out from Washington to occupy the States. But that course 
      of action turned out to be unnecessary. Henry failed to foresee the

      federal authority in exchange for apparent but actually illusory 
      collective aid and protection. (This is in fact the relationship between 
      lord and serf in medieval feudalism.) Patrick Henry failed to anticipate 
      federal income tax, and the concessions of authority the states would have 
      to endure in order to reclaim part of the funds confiscated from their 
      citizens. Even worse, he failed to envision the corporate state and

      <P>It's no secret that progressives derive their notion of <I>progressive 
      income tax</I> from the tenets of Marx. The idea was to capture a portion 
      of the gains imagined to be immorally acquired by the <I>"rich."</I> The 
      first American income taxes were only 1 percent on the first $20,000 of 
      taxable income and 7 percent on incomes above $500,000. (These levels of 
      income correspond roughly to $300,000 and $7,500,000 today.) So, to most 
      people in 1913, income tax was an easy sell. Under those terms, it could 
      probably be sold again today, even to most of those who despise it. Even 
      as late as 1939, only 5 percent of the population were even required to 
      file returns. </P></DIV>

      <P>How did we all get forced into the higher brackets? Well, that's where 
      the double edge of the hidden tax of inflation comes into play with 
      progressive income tax. Not only did fiat money controllers benefit from 
      issuing and expanding currency in all its evolving forms, they also 
      benefited as the depreciating currency forced even common laborers into 
      the class originally designated as <I>"rich." </I>Early on, common 
      laborers were no doubt proud of the fact that they were finally earning 
      enough to be included in with the millionaires who had to pay a small 
      percentage of their income in taxes for such worthy causes as retirement 
      for the elderly and WWII. It simply didn't occur to them that the currency 
      depreciation would finally force them to yield as much as half of their 
      income. Keynes himself argued that a currency depreciating at 1 percent 
      per year and requiring an entire century to lose 63 percent of its value 
      was a small price to pay for full employment.[*]</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>And of course FDR created a method of streamlining the collection 
      process in 1943 with the implementation of the system of <I>withholding 
      </I>taxes from wages and salaries during WWII. Some economists argue that 
      the device of withholding taxes from wages was the principle factor that 
      shifted income tax from a tax on the wealthy to a tax on the 
      masses.</P></DIV>

      the hybrid private/government institution known as the Federal Reserve. If

      to capture a percentage of the product of business and labor in order to 
      repay loans made to the Treasury by the FED. When federal budget deficits 
      become high enough, among the few recourses the Treasury has to meet its 
      obligations is either to increase taxes or to monetize the debt. So taxes

      somehow live to see what kind of global taxing authority will be milking 
      the world's population at the end of the 21<SUP>st</SUP> 
century.</P></DIV>

      <P>Some of the most respected thinkers of the Enlightenment opposed making 
      tax evasion a crime. William Blackstone, Adam Smith, and Montesquieu all 
      condemned severe tax laws. Montesquieu wrote that it "was contrary to the 
      spirit of moderate government." "Severe punishments for tax offenses," 
      wrote Blackstone, "destroys all proportion of punishment, and puts 
      murderers upon equal footing with such as are really guilty of no natural, 
      but merely a positive offense." But you might find it difficult to agree 
      even with such profound and influential thinkers.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>If you're firmly established in the system, you might tend to side with 
      the view that any opposition to the validity of modern income tax laws is 
      tantamount to anarchy. You might find it impossible to overcome the knee 
      jerk tendency to shy away from any challenge, even by intellectual 
      reference, to the power of the entrenched institutions. But another way to 
      view it, and not without merit, is to consider that direct taxation of 
      income is actually little more than <B>"<I>Fractional Slavery.</I>"</B> So 
      we've coined a new term and you can use it as you please. Where overt 
      slavery is unacceptable, fractional slavery is currently popular. Whether 
      that fraction might be as low as 1 percent -- although I wouldn't venture 
      to guess where in the world that might be -- or as high as 100 percent as 
      in the former Soviet Union, it's still slavery by percentage.</P></DIV>
      <DIV align=justify>
      <P>To confirm this notion, just consider how it actually is. Not how it's 
      interpreted by the pundits and apologists of the system -- those who would 
      ridicule the very suggestion that <B>income tax is a form of slavery</B> 
      -- but how it actually is. And rise above the argument about necessity or 
      general welfare. Just reduce the facts to a syllogism. A group of people 
      create fiat currency and lend it through state institutions to fund public 
      programs from welfare to warfare. They compel the public to 
      <I>"volunteer"</I> a percentage of their lifetime at wage-labor or 
      business to pay back what was never owed in the first place, and with 
      interest. If anyone opts not to "volunteer," they are stripped of as much 
      as 100 percent of their assets, or imprisoned where 100 percent of their 
      time belongs to the state. Now this is arguably a form of slavery, however 
      covert or clever. Denying it is like claiming that the ultimate 
      distillation of alcohol isn't really alcohol simply because you dilute it 
      again as a percentage of some mixed barroom cocktail concoction with an 
      exotic patented name. The argument is reasonable even if a percentage of 
      the revenue is redistributed through state institutional programs. If it's 
      not truly voluntary, it's coercive. And if people are coerced into 
      surrendering their labor and their property, they are by default under 
      duress <FONT face=Symbol>¾</FONT> under a form of tyranny. They are 
      therefore only less than full slaves by a relative percentage and by 
      relative choice. You can stay in the system and yield 20-90 percent of 
      your life and labor, or you can drop out and panhandle on the street 
      corner, or you can go to prison. It seems that an exceedingly clever power 
      elite in America has realized for some time now that the <I>"best slave is 
      the one who thinks he's free."</I></P></DIV>

      <P>One unnerving aspect of the cattle analogy &#8212; where elites empower their 
      collectivist social engineers to herd us like their cattle or chattel &#8212; is 
      the method trail bosses used to deal with any individual animal following 
      its own mind. If it caused the others to stray and threaten the goals of 
      the cattle owners, then without hesitation the trail boss shot it on the 
      spot. If this doesn't remind you of the cute little practice of the 
      Communist Chinese and the Soviet Socialists in regard to any perceived 
      political threat to the system, you haven't been paying attention. You've 
      been spending too much of your time watching sitcoms, entertainment award 
      ceremonies, or ball games and too little considering the reality around 
      you. The Marxists shot the individual in the back of the head with a 
      single bullet, and sent the empty shell casing along with a bill for its 
      cost to the surviving family members. You can bet the survivors paid those 
      few pennies for the bullet, and you can bet they learned to sit up and 
      take notice. You can bet they learned to keep their mouths positively 
      shut. When queried if they had free speech and free elections protected by 
      their constitution, citizens would uniformly smile and reply, "Oh, 
      absolutely&#8230;absolutely." Those that dared to challenge the charade were 
      gone overnight. The popular adage was<I> "They pretend to pay us, and we 
      pretend to work." </I>Even in America, all but the most ignorant and 
      uninformed comprehend the political meaning of the word <I>"Siberia."</I>

      <P>On the reality television show, LAPD, a Los Angeles police officer used 
      this phrase to define an armed robber: "&#8230;a guy who points a gun at people 
      and demands their property." As April 15<SUP>th</SUP> approaches, how many 
      secretly think of the behemoth we call the federal government in similar 
      terms? The IRS has recently begun to issue firearms to its employees. Its 
      fellow agency FinCEN is trying to implement the "know your customer" 
      spying regulations in banking. The IRS has strategically removed signs and 
      marking from its buildings to render them less conspicuous. It can 
      withhold the issuance of a passport if it calculates that you owe it 
      money. It has been credibly accused of illegally auditing political 
      opponents of the federal executive office. And it has begun to imprison 
      individuals with sentences comparable to those Stalin imposed. Could we 
      blame a person for at least instinctively making the association with an 
      armed robber, before forever banishing the thought from his mind in an 
      attempt at self-preservation? Oh, yeah. I <I>love</I> the king's new suit 
      of clothes. I <I>really</I> love it.</P></DIV>

      <P>One thing's for sure. As we reach into our depreciating savings to fork 
      over the percentage demanded by the boys and girls from the central 
      protection agency, we know who the April Fools really are, and it ain't 
      Uncle Sam's elite or those who pull his chain. </P></DIV>
