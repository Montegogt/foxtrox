  align=right> <FONT face=arial color=blue>The idea to celebrate Christmas on 
  December 25 originated in the 4th century. The Catholic Church wanted to 
  eclipse the festivities of a rival pagan religion that threatened 
  Christianity's existence. The Romans celebrated the birthday of their sun god, 
  Mithras during this time of year. Although it was not popular, or even proper, 
  to celebrate people's birthdays in those times, church leaders decided that in 
  order to compete with the pagan celebration they would themselves order a 
  festival in celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Although the actual 
  season of Jesus' birth is thought to be in the spring, the date of December 25 
  was chosen as the official birthday celebration as Christ's Mass so that it 
  would compete head on with the rival pagan celebration. Christmas was slow to 
  catch on in America. The early colonists considered it a pagan ritual. The 
  celebration of Christmas was even banned by law in Massachusetts in colonial 
  days.

  align=left> <FONT face=arial color=red><B>Mistletoe and 
  Holly</B><BR></FONT>Two hundred years before the birth of Christ, the Druids 
  used mistletoe to celebrate the coming of winter. They would gather this 
  evergreen plant that is parasitic upon other trees and used it to decorate 
  their homes. They believed the plant had special healing powers for everything 
  from female infertility to poison ingestion. Scandinavians also thought of 
  mistletoe as a plant of peace and harmony. They associated mistletoe with 
  their goddess of love, Frigga. The custom of kissing under the mistletoe 
  probably derived from this belief. The early church banned the use of 
  mistletoe in Christmas celebrations because of its pagan origins. Instead, 
  church fathers suggested the use of holly as an appropriate substitute for 
  Christmas greenery.

  color=red><B>Poinsettias</B><BR></FONT>Poinsettias are native to Mexico. They 
  were named after America's first ambassador to Mexico, Joel Poinsett. He 
  brought the plants to America in 1828. The Mexicans in the eighteenth century 
  thought the plants were symbolic of the Star of Bethlehem. Thus the Poinsettia 
  became associated with the Christmas season. The actual flower of the 
  poinsettia is small and yellow. But surrounding the flower are large, bright 
  red leaves, often mistaken for petals.

  align=right> <FONT face=arial color=red><B>The Christmas 
  Tree</B><BR></FONT>The Christmas Tree originated in Germany in the 16th 
  century. It was common for the Germanic people to decorate fir trees, both 
  inside and out, with roses, apples, and colored paper. It is believed that 
  Martin Luther, the Protestant reformer, was the first to light a Christmas 
  tree with candles. While coming home one dark winter's night near Christmas, 
  he was struck with the beauty of the starlight shining through the branches of 
  a small fir tree outside his home. He duplicated the starlight by using 
  candles attached to the branches of his indoor Christmas tree. The Christmas 
  tree was not widely used in Britain until the 19th century. It was brought to 
  America by the Pennsylvania Germans in the 1820's. 
  <P><FONT face=arial color=red><B>Xmas</B><BR></FONT>This abbreviation for 
  Christmas is of Greek origin. The word for Christ in Greek is Xristos. During 
  the 16th century, Europeans began using the first initial of Christ's name, 
  "X" in place of the word Christ in Christmas as a shorthand form of the word. 
  Although the early Christians understood that X stood for Christ's name, later 
  Christians who did not understand the Greek language mistook "Xmas" as a sign 
  of disrespect. 
  <P><IMG src="candy_cane_swing_md_clr.gif" align=left> <FONT face=arial color=red><B>The Candy 
  Cane</B><BR></FONT>Candy canes have been around for centuries, but it wasn't 
  until around 1900 that they were decorated with red stripes and bent into the 
  shape of a cane. They were sometimes handed out during church services to keep 
  the children quiet. One story (almost certainly false) that is often told 
  about the origin of the candy cane is as follows: 
  <P>In the late 1800's a candy maker in Indiana wanted to express the meaning 
  of Christmas through a symbol made of candy. He came up with the idea of 
  bending one of his white candy sticks into the shape of a Candy Cane. He 
  incorporated several symbols of Christ's love and sacrifice through the Candy 
  Cane. First, he used a plain white peppermint stick. The color white 
  symbolizes the purity and sinless nature of Jesus. Next, he added three small 
  stripes to symbolize the pain inflicted upon Jesus before His death on the 
  cross. There are three of them to represent the Holy Trinity. He added a bold 
  stripe to represent the blood Jesus shed for mankind. When looked at with the 
  crook on top, it looks like a shepherd's staff because Jesus is the shepherd 
  of man. If you turn it upside down, it becomes the letter J symbolizing the 
  first letter in Jesus' name. The candy maker made these candy canes for 
  Christmas, so everyone would remember what Christmas is all about.

  align=right> <FONT face=arial color=red><B>Santa Claus</B><BR></FONT>The 
  original Santa Claus, St. Nicholas, was born in Turkey in the 4th century. He 
  was very pious from an early age, devoting his life to Christianity. He became 
  widely known for his generosity for the poor. But the Romans held him in 
  contempt. He was imprisoned and tortured. But when Constantine became emperor 
  of Rome, he allowed Nicholas to go free. Constantine became a Christian and 
  convened the Council of Nicaea in 325. Nicholas was a delegate to the council. 
  He is especially noted for his love of children and for his generosity. He is 
  the patron saint of sailors, Sicily, Greece, and Russia. He is also, of 
  course, the patron saint of children. The Dutch kept the legend of St. 
  Nicholas alive. In 16th century Holland, Dutch children would place their 
  wooden shoes by the hearth in hopes that they would be filled with a treat. 
  The Dutch spelled St. Nicholas as Sint Nikolaas, which became corrupted to 
  Sinterklaas, and finally, in Anglican, to Santa Claus. In 1822, Clement C. 
  Moore composed his famous poem, "A Visit from St. Nick," which was later 
  published as "The Night Before Christmas." Moore is credited with creating the 
  modern image of Santa Claus as a jolly fat man in a red suit.</FONT>
