      <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">We were very excited the first time we saw 
      the new <A href="http://www.mickeythompsontires.com/" target=_blank>Mickey 
      Thompson Baja Claw tires</A>. These tires have a look that turned heads 
      and it seemed they could back up the hype but you just never know until 
      the rubber meets the dirt. That's why we jumped at the chance to test a 
      set on our Project YJ. This is a very capable Jeep and it needed to have a 
      set of tires that could get it into and out of some really challenging 
      trails. After our first serious test we have some results I think you're 
      going to like. These tires have more bite than bark and we haven't found 
      too many situations where they do anything less than amaze. Follow along 
      and we'll show you what we mean.</FONT></P>

            <P align=center><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">This is a perfect place 
            for the Baja Claw's, wheels up and taking no prisoners! With our 
            axles locked front and rear we knew that we would be the rig to beat 
            for traction! Those massive Sidebiters® saved our bacon on more than 
            a few occasions and made believers out of all that were watching the 
            brutal treatment these tires got time after time. Twice the Jeep was 
            on it's side and we just bumped the starter to get us back on all 
            fours! That's raw traction and you can't beat that out in the rough 
            stuff.&nbsp;</FONT></P></FONT></B></TD>

            face="Trebuchet MS">Tire pressure is always something you have to 
            experiment with on the trail and a new tire makes for some 
            interesting conversations around the campfire. The 6 ply sidewall 
            makes this tire pretty stiff so we thought that the pressure would 
            have to be fairly low. We started at 15psi but that bounced down the 
            trail. 13 was a bit better but 8psi was the winner. It even went 7 
            miles down the paved road to town for gas the first day. Even with 
            this low pressure we had very little deflection and the tire held 
            it's shape over rocks.</FONT>

            <P align=center><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">Look at this picture and 
            see if you can tell what's wrong here. The tire hasn't shredded 
            itself on that stump! Toothpicks and kindling were flying out as we 
            tried to free the Jeep from this predicament. The tube bumper (Now 
            about 6" shorter on each side thanks to a Sawzall) got hooked on the 
            stump and the tire was wedged in under it. As the 6 ply sidewall 
            just rubbed and burned away everyone was waiting for the next sound, 
            POP! It never happened and we were able to drive away unscathed. Not 
            one person there, even me, thought that was going to be possible but 
            there it was. This was the moment about 4 people in the group 
            decided this was going to be their next tire. In fact, I was lucky 
            to have gotten out of there with these tires. I was warned not to 
            stray too far from the Jeep or they wouldn't be there when I got 
            back.</FONT></FONT></B></P></TD>

          <TD width="50%"><FONT face="Trebuchet MS"><B><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">The 
            last test we had for them was the Mud! There were two lines of 
            thought here, either they were going to eat it like corn flakes or 
            they were going to do the China Syndrome thing and head for the 
            earth's core. We were happy to find it was the first and these tires 
            hold the distinction of being the only ones the make it through the 
            hard line un-assisted. We were on our side with both right side 
            tires in the air and the Sidebiters® got us up and out of the hole. 
            Sorry there are no pictures but I was in the Jeep at the time and 
            it's a little difficult to get the shot from there. I hear it looked 
            awesome!</FONT></FONT></B></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><FONT

      <P><FONT face="Trebuchet MS">So are these tires worth it? Considering they 
      will get you through some pretty serious stuff and live to tell about it I 
      think Yes, they're worth every penny. It's better than walking home, 
      right? The other big thing are it's street manners. Most people use their 
      trail rigs for at lease some street use and the tires should have some 
      ability to handle this. These tires do more than just handle the street, 
      they excel at it. We had a 100 mile drive both ways to the trail and were 
      really happy how they handled. The noise level is similar to an all 
      terrain tire and the grip on the road was excellent. Most of the drive was 
      on curving mountain or windy roads and they really gave us a very 
      comfortable feel. These are soft tires so I can't imagine they are going 
      to put up with too much street use but they are a good tire for whatever 
      you do. We still have to test them in rain, snow, ice, and sand but I 
      think we'll have to give them the benefit of the doubt from now 
      on.</FONT></P>
