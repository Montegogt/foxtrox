      <P><FONT size=+1>The things you can do to assure getting the long life 
      built into the Super Swamper TSL tires are:</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>1) Keep your truck in good mechanical condition and do 
      not run with worn out shocks.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT size=+1>2) Maintain the proper air pressure for your driving and 
      load conditions. Check the air pressure once a month with a <B>GOOD</B> 
      accurate air gauge. Two things support the weight of a vehicle...the 
      volume of air and....the airs pressure. With big tires the large volume of 
      air in the tire will <B>SUPPORT</B> the vehicle but the tire will not be 
      stable...the tire will look <B>OK</B> but when running on the highway at 
      high speed it will wiggle and squirm which the tire is not designed for 
      and it will not deliver near the mileage it could with the proper 
      inflation pressure. This is not important when running off road because 
      you don't have the speed plus the ground is softer than the tire but when 
      you get back on the highway you should bring the pressure back up again to 
      whatever pressure you have determined is best for the loads carried and 
      your driving habits. Big tires will almost always <B>LOOK</B> like they 
      have enough air when actually they may not for highway driving. So don't 
      just kick your tires...check them. If you want to see what we mean try 
      letting the air pressure down to 12 pounds or so...you probably won't be 
      able to notice anything abnormal unless yours is a very heavy truck...but 
      the tire, at 12 PSI is seriously under inflated for highway 
      service.<BR><BR>3) Rotate the tires front to back and back to front about 
      every four to six thousand miles...do not criss-cross...keep the tires on 
      the same side of the vehicle. This practice will help to even out the 
      uneven wear that often shows up on the front tires' outer lugs from hard 
      cornering or a lot of in-town driving.</FONT></P></TD></TR>

      <P>Disclaimer: As much as we would like to help, we cannot and will not 
      give advice on fitting our tires to any particular vehicle. Ride height 
      changes due to age and use do not allow for steadfast rules. Your local 
      retailer may be able to help by inspecting your vehicle first hand. </P>
