      <P><IMG align=right height=108 src="pics/dana2527.jpeg" 
      width=175><BR><BR><STRONG>DANA 25/27</STRONG><BR>These Danas are 
      indistinguishable in appearance. The military Model 25 has a thick, cast 
      cover, while the 27 and civilian-model 25s have a thinner cover, will 
      accept taller gears, and backed V-6s. </P>
      <HR>

      <P><STRONG>DANA 28</STRONG><BR>The alloy-case Dana 28, with a 6 
      5/8-inch-diameter ring gear, came in Bronco IIs and Rangers with anything 
      but the 4.0-liter engine. Although 4.0-liter trucks come with Dana 35s, 
      most of the front suspension and/or drivetrain needs to be swapped to 
      replace a 28. </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=left height=121 src="pics/dana30.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 30</STRONG><BR>The Model 30, with a 7 
      1/8-inch-diameter ring gear, was the standard front differential in some 
      1972-75 CJ-5s and all 1975-and-later CJ-5s and CJ-7s. It is still used in 
      the front of Cherokees and Comanches, and will probably appear in the 
      front of the Grand Cherokee. </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=102 src="pics/dana35.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 35</STRONG><BR>This axle, with a 7.56-inch ring 
      gear, is the fronted for 4.0-liter Ford Rangers and Explorers/Mazda 
      Navajos. The 35C version is found in the rear of Cherokees and Comanches.

      <P><IMG align=left height=134 src="pics/dana41.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 41</STRONG><BR>The 41, which has a ring gear size 
      similar to the Dana 44, came in early CJ-2As. The spiders are the same as 
      a 44's, but the carrier and gears aren't. It is almost universally swapped 
      out in favor of a Dana 44. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=124 src="pics/dana44.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 44 </STRONG><BR>All domestic manufacturers have 
      used Dana axles, and the 44, with its 8 1/2-inch ring gear, is likely to 
      be a step up on anything smaller than a 1/2-ton. A narrowed 44 could be 
      the hot ticket for vehicles smaller than a full-size sport-utility. It was 
      standard under the front of pre-1976 Chevy Blazers and 1/2-tons, solid 
      front-axled F-150s and Broncos, and Jeep J-10/J-20s and Grand Wagoneers. 
      </P>

      <P><IMG align=left height=112 src="pics/dana44ifs.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 44-IF</STRONG><BR>The Ford-version Dana 44 
      Twin-Traction-Beam setup is similar to other 44s (ring gear diameters are 
      identical), but there are no axle tubes and the "cover" is actually the 
      suspension arm. It's standard in the front of any TTB-equipped Ford except 
      the F-250HD, which uses a Dana 50. </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=109 src="pics/dana60.jpg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 60 </STRONG><BR>A Dana 60 looks deceptively similar 
      to a Dana 44, but the 60's 9 3/4-inch ring gear diameter is a major factor 
      in strength. It can be found in many 3/4-ton pickup and van rear ends. 
</P>

      <P><IMG align=left height=123 src="pics/dana70.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>DANA 70</STRONG><BR>Almost identical in appearance to a 
      Dana 60, the Dana 70 is standard in heavy Dodge pickups and GM duallies. 
      The large 10.54-inch ring gear diameter will tolerate much torque, and is 
      suitable for diesel power and/or big tires. </P>
      <P> </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=107 src="pics/ford75in.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>FORD 7.5-INCH</STRONG><BR>The small Ford rear end, which 
      sometimes uses a fiberglass cover, is found in Bronco IIs and 
      non-4.0-liter-powered Rangers. For bigger tires and/or engines, it's 
      usually swapped for a Ford 9-inch.<BR></P>
      <P> </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=left height=104 src="pics/ford88in.jpeg" 
      width=175><B>FORD 8.8-INCH</B><BR>The 8.8-inch debuted in 1983 Broncos and 
      F-150s, and is now found also in 4.0-liter Rangers and Explorers/Navajos. 
      It is easily distinguished from a 9-inch by having a cover on the back. 
      </P>

      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=96 src="pics/ford9in.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>FORD 9-INCH</STRONG><BR>The venerable Ford 9-inch is 
      both readily available and strong. Later models have bigger axle tubes and 
      stronger housings. It was standard under 1966-88 F-150s and Broncos. It 
      also came on many vans and the Lincoln Versailles (a popular axle for 
      swapping because of the Lincoln version's disc brakes with parking brake).

      <P><IMG align=left height=106 src="pics/ford1025in.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>FORD 10.25-INCH</STRONG><BR>Ford's biggest axle comes 
      with semi-floating shafts in 1983-and-newer F-250s, and as a full-floater 
      in F-250HDs and F-350s. Applications are similar to the big GM 14-bolt and 
      the Dana 70.<BR></P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=107 src="pics/gm10bolt75in.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 10-BOLT</STRONG><BR>The GM 10-bolt is named 
      for the number of bolts on the cover; ring gear diameter is 7 1/2 inches. 
      Variations of this can be found in the rear of GM S-trucks and some 
      Isuzus, and in the front of S-trucks. </P>

      <P><IMG align=left height=116 src="pics/gm10bolt85in.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 10-BOLT</STRONG><BR>This 10-bolt, with a 
      larger 8 1/2-inch ring gear diameter, replaced the Dana 44 that was used 
      in the front of some pre-1977 GMs. It can also be found in the back of 
      1983-91 1/2-tons and in the front of 1983-87 1/2-tons.<BR></P>

      src="pics/gmcorporate12bolt.jpeg" width=175><STRONG>GM 
      CORPORATE 12-BOLT</STRONG><BR>The stronger 12-bolt, with an 8 
      7/8-inch-diameter ring gear, can be found in various 1964-82 GM 1/2- and 
      3/4-ton rearends. </P>

      <P><IMG align=left height=112 src="pics/gmcorp14bolt9.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 14-BOLT </STRONG><BR>The "small" GM 14-bolt 
      has a 9 1/2-inch ring gear diameter. It was used in the rear of 
      1964-and-later GM pickups, and in the rear of 1984-91 3/4-ton 
      Suburbans.<BR><BR></P>

      <P><IMG align=right height=116 src="pics/gmcorp14bolt10.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 14-BOLT</STRONG><BR>With a 10 
      1/2-inch-diameter ring gear, the biggest 14-bolt GM rearend looks much 
      like a Dana 70, and is but a few thousandths of an inch shorter in ring 
      gear diameter. This axle is commonly used with big engines and/or overly 
      large tires. It was used under 1973-87 3/4-tons. </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=left height=116 src="pics/amcmodel20.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>AMC MODEL 20</STRONG><BR>Used in 1976-and-later Jeep 
      CJs, the Model 20 rearend is both strong and weak. An 8 3/4-inch-diameter 
      ring gear provides strength; weaknesses are the housing itself and the 
      axle-to-hub retaining method. Converting to one-piece axles or 
      full-floaters gives this axle better stamina. </P>
      <HR>

      <P><IMG align=right height=107 src="pics/chrysler914inch.jpeg" 
      width=175><STRONG>CHRYSLER 9 1/4-INCH</STRONG><BR>Mopar's 9 1/4-inch 
      rearend can put a stop (notice the octagonal stop sign cover shape) to 
      rearend woes on many lesser-equipped vehicles. Chrysler has used these 
      since 1969, on 1/2- and 3/4-tons. </P>

      <HR>

      <P><STRONG>TOYOTA 7.8-INCH</STRONG><BR>Close to eight inches in ring gear 
      diameter, this rearend has been used on 1979-and-later 4Runners and 
      pickups. The four-cylinder turbo and 1988-and-later V-6 models have larger 
      side carriers and the same ring size in front.
